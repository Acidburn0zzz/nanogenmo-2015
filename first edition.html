To the best of my knowledge, this was Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice in 1806. It looked as if it was appointed as Chancellor by Prime Minister David Cameron on 11 May 2010. Passepartout remarked that it didn't become the Chancellor's official residence until 1828. Passepartout and I admired the larger living area. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was the Prime Minister's press office?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"See for yourself." I replied. <!--visiting 51.502658983954/-0.12714978251567 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by was Downing Street. It was clearly built in the 1680s by Sir George Downing (1632-1689). My guidebook claimed it was built in the 1680s by Sir George Downing. Passepartout commented that it didn't become "10" until 1787. We joined some tourists who were admiring the official residence at Number 12. It was hard to believe it was ever a metonym for the Government of the United Kingdom. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the Prime Minister's Press Office. It was within convenient distance of St&period; James's Park. We encounted some problems with an increase in violence. <!--visiting 51.502492285559/-0.12681648283678 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Foreign and Commonwealth Office. I remembered it was created in 1968 by merging the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Office. To the best of my knowledge, this was formed in March 1782 by combining the Southern and Northern Departments of the Secretary of State. Passepartout remembered it becoming the responsibility of the separate Department for International Development. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was offices and storage since the Second World War?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I replied. I tripped over a Government timeline to show the departments responsible for Foreign Affairs from 1945. It was handy for resources. <!--visiting 51.501964596647/-0.12701082557618 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to HM Treasury. I remembered it was called the Lord Treasurer. If I remembered correctly, this was responsible for appointing George Downing. Passepartout examined a detailed analysis of departmental spending under thousands of category headings. It was convenient for finance. We met John, an old colleague of mine who lived nearby. <!--visiting 51.500964753119/-0.1271773285618 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather improved as we approached Parliament Square. It was clearly removed in 1940 and placed in its present position in nearby Victoria Tower Gardens in 1957. Unless I was mistaken, this was redesigned by George Grey Wornum. We visited eleven statues of British. I spent a while examining ten statues of statesmen and other notable individuals. We took advantage of for a different regime of "prohibited activities". Passepartout spoke of the time when it was erected in Manchester. <!--visiting 51.499825849819/-0.12598291342698 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.498540791324/-0.12557670097554 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With some urgency, we walked to House of Lords. It looked as if it was once an entitlement of all hereditary peers. I could see that it was restricted to 92 hereditary peers. Passepartout observed that it didn't assemble again until the Convention Parliament met in 1660 and the monarchy was restored. John and I admired the defined 650-seat membership. We took advantage of that whenever a vacancy arises among the Lords Spiritual during the ten years following the Act coming into force. Things were never the same after the establishment of the Supreme Court in 2009. At this point, John noticed the time and said they had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at HM Treasury. We noted the perceived constitutional anomalies inherent in the role. <!--visiting 51.498076261286/-0.12417738387804 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">Close by was Palace of Westminster. Passepartout talked about  the Royal Gallery. It looked as if it was destroyed by fire in 1834. If I remembered correctly, this was built on the site in the eleventh century. Passepartout observed that it didn't have a chamber of its own. Passepartout and I silently remembered members and staff of both Houses who died in the Second World War. Passepartout remembered it becoming clear that some of the stonework had to be replaced. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a symbol of the strength of democracy?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I said. Passepartout examined the Court of Requests; the expansion of the Peerage by King George III during the 18th century. It was convenient for the Chamber. Passepartout said it was believed to have been originally supported by pillars. The mood here changed after a fire destroyed much of the complex in 1512. We were approached by a passer-by, who introduced themselves as Edward. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"It rises up from the ground in this stately rhythm, higher and higher, before you reach the clock face, picked out as a giant rose, its petals fringed with gold." said Edward. We noted pollution and the poor quality of some of the stone used. <!--visiting 51.498436878777/-0.12403854992534 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearby was Parliament of the United Kingdom. Imagine my amazement to learn it was created in 1801 by the merger of the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland under the Acts of Union! I could see that it was superior to the House of Commons both in theory and in practice. We visited the Northern Ireland Assembly. Edward remembered it becoming an independent supreme court in 2009. I admired the fixed term of 5 years. It seemed quite suitable for important legislation. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Gracious Speech." said Edward. We avoided land erosion. <!--visiting 51.498575912962/-0.12406635748343 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We approached Burning of Parliament. It was clearly largely destroyed by fire on 16 October 1834. I could see that it was won by Charles Barry. Passepartout observed that it didn't call for assistance. Passepartout and I enjoyed no visible effect. Were there nine or ten casualties? Passepartout didn't seem to care. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really the home of the British parliament?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. We looked for other parts of the old Houses of Parliament but struggled to find any. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to burn coal--which gives off a high heat with little flame--and not wood. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I may term corporeal conveniences were..." said Edward. <!--visiting 51.498575912962/-0.12406635748343 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.497346522573/-0.12349365775609 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.49360206835/-0.12181400385867 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to MI5. Unless I was mistaken, this was put before parliament on the 4th of November 2015. Passepartout asked me if it was split into naval and army sections which, but I did not know. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was placed on a statutory basis in 1989 with the introduction of the Security Service Act. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to give the Germans a false impression of the location and timings of the landings (see Operation Fortitude). Things were different after the early part of the Second World War. <!--visiting 51.493243225228/-0.12492659073645 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Tate. I could see that it was designed by Wolff Olins in 2000. It looked as if it was established by the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 as The Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery. Passepartout observed that it didn't wish to abide by guidelines that deaccessioned work should first be offered to other museums. We enjoyed exclusively by Tate and items represented in its collection. We joined some tourists who were admiring the range of logos that move in and out of focus. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was the operating name for the corporate body?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. I tripped over the United Kingdom's national collection of British art. It was handy for its archives which he then used to forge documents authenticating fake modern paintings that he then sold. At this point, Edward entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <!--visiting 51.490271574378/-0.12631487511139 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Millbank Tower. I remembered it was constructed in 1963 for Vickers and was originally known as Vickers Tower. Passepartout said it was originally known as Vickers Tower. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for press conferences." said Passepartout. We bumped into a local shopkeeper, who introduced themselves as Ronald. <!--visiting 51.49149309692/-0.12528743214789 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It began to rain as we approached Thames House. Imagine my surprise to learn it was built to designs by Sir Frank Baines! I recalled it was redesigned from 1929. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was government offices by then?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I said. Things were different after it was sold to the British Government in 1994. At this point, Ronald departed from our company, saying that they had to return home via Millbank Tower. <!--visiting 51.493243225228/-0.12492659073645 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky darkened as we approached Lambeth Bridge. It looked as if it was by then severely corroded. Imagine my surprise to learn it was closed to vehicular traffic! Passepartout explained how it had been designed to be able to cope with a higher weight of motorised traffic. We met Peter, an old friend of mine who was in the area. <!--visiting 51.49371502181/-0.12237149194433 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">Crossing a main road, we approached Lambeth Palace. It looked as if it was a larger area with a notable orchard until the early 19th century. I could see that it was low and sodden: it was called Lambeth Marsh. We admired the tower of 1377 repaired in 1834 and the rest was rebuilt in 1851 using architect P C Hardwick. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a vast collection of material relating to ecclesiastical history. <!--visiting 51.494825864181/-0.11903878975208 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. Passepartout told me it was added to its name in 1988. It was clearly the statutory regulatory and professional body for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in England. We took advantage of members with the post-nominals 'MRPharmS' and those members who have been awarded fellowships with 'FRPharmS'. <!--visiting 51.493770044403/-0.1185165054306 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It began to rain as we approached The Queen's Walk (South Bank). I remembered it was not established until the completion of construction of London Bridge City c&period;1990 In 1996. Passepartout said it was recognised as a foundation for establishing the Thames Path national trail through London. The mood here changed after the completion of construction of London Bridge City c&period;1990 In 1996. <!--visiting 51.49371638181/-0.12237148194433 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.493040088806/-0.11783301086121 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Peter and I walked to Garden Museum. Passepartout told me it was largely a Victorian reconstruction. If I remembered correctly, this was deconsecrated in 1972 and was scheduled to be demolished. I admired the altar tomb outside. I found and admired the 15th and 16th century tombs of many members of the Howard family. Things were different after the churchyard was closed in 1854. At this point, Peter noticed the time and said they had to leave, saying that they had to return to Lambeth Bridge. <!--visiting 51.49427011781/-0.11951642704225 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Lambeth Walk. I remembered it was at the heart of a working class residential area and there was a street market. It was clearly originally developed with wells and a recreation ground. I recalled the popular song of the same name. Passepartout and I recalled Charlie Chaplin whose early years were spent nearby. Passepartout recounted how it had been rebuilt. <!--visiting 51.49313923804/-0.11367713219102 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to A23 road. Imagine my surprise to learn it was originally proposed to run as far north as Streatham! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't imagine a worse place for various other London to Brighton events." said Passepartout. He spoke of the time when it was completed in 2007. We admired the famous superstores. We moved on, disappointed by a lack of funds. <!--visiting 51.497268598603/-0.11131805279025 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Lambeth North tube station. I recalled it was opened by the Baker Street & Waterloo Railway on 10 March 1906. It looked as if it was changed to Westminster Bridge Road in July 1906 and it was again renamed. We were greeted by a passer-by, who introduced themselves as Leslie. <!--visiting 51.498268442254/-0.11111822051684 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to St George's Cathedral, Southwark. Passepartout asked me if it was caused by incendiary bombing Opened in 1848, but I did not know. He said it was designed by Augustus Pugin. It seemed quite suitable for the Convocations of the Academy of Saint Cecilia. We moved on, disappointed by copyright material being used. <!--visiting 51.497066990759/-0.10721861935337 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">We passed the site of St George's Fields. Passepartout told me it was an area of Southwark in South London. He asked me if it was an undifferentiated part of the south-side of the Thames, but I did not know. Things were never the same after the Reformation changes and its dissolution. <!--visiting 51.497879004169/-0.10431917468879 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was London South Bank University. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was founded in 1892 as the Borough Polytechnic Institute! Passepartout asked me if it was chosen to be clerk to the Governing Body, but I did not know. Passepartout was unimpressed by the training and demonstrating Centre for Efficient and Renewable Energy in Buildings (CEREB). Leslie explained to us how it had been designed to include two Thames barges set above a pentagon surrounded by five other pentagons. We noted stricter student visa requirements in the United Kingdom. <!--visiting 51.497407134377/-0.10085962658849 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Ministry of Sound. It looked as if it was conceived as an arena purely dedicated to sound. Passepartout said it was purely this: 100% sound system first. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"My concept for Ministry was purely this: 100% sound system first, lights second, design third (in that order); the reverse of everyone else's idea." said Leslie. <!--visiting 51.497044633648/-0.098486599102109 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Leslie and I walked to Metro Central Heights. It was clearly originally known as Alexander Fleming House. I could see that it was not known at the time of construction. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to some 400 studio to three-bedroom flats which are in constant demand. <!--visiting 51.495078571567/-0.098559651159294 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Elephant & Castle tube station. It looked as if it was approved on 25 July 1890. My guidebook claimed it was given of a private bill that would be presented to Parliament for the construction of the BS&WR. It was within convenient distance of the Bakerloo line. We made full benefit of the most direct access to the Bakerloo line. <!--visiting 51.493667380848/-0.09901938272693 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Leslie and I walked to Metropolitan Tabernacle. To the best of my recollection, this was the largest non-conformist church of its day in 1861. Passepartout said it was William Rider; other notable pastors and preachers include Benjamin Keach. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a film location in 1991 which portrayed the building as a London night club?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. Passepartout was unimpressed by a below-floor baptism pool. We took advantage of free video and audio downloads. <!--visiting 51.493434923338/-0.100430242552 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.492934741695/-0.09833876545386 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.487770006746/-0.094876677163235 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 51.483576379727/-0.083451439436739 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Leslie and I hitched a lift to Burgess Park. If I remembered correctly, this was carved out of a highly built-up area of the city. I remembered it was the closure of the Grand Surrey Canal in the early 1970s. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to some former roads which have been stopped up but not yet grassed over. Leslie explained how it had been designed to reflect the diversity of the surrounding population of this highly cosmopolitan portion of London. <!--visiting 51.482842279037/-0.081161549082905 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.485101458109/-0.091269253967522 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.481797367567/-0.098382427861256 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Kennington Park. Unless I was mistaken, this was opened in 1854 on the site of what had been Kennington Common. I could see that it was a site of public executions until 1800 as well as being an area for public speaking. It seemed quite suitable for major cricket matches in 1724. We took advantage of a local forum for this struggle. <!--visiting 51.483436622647/-0.10820549343695 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky clouded over as we approached Oval tube station. It looked as if it was both the first standard gauge tube and the first railway to employ electric traction in London. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was shield-driven at deep level! I found and admired some of the lift equipment; the main part of the building was of red brick. <!--visiting 51.481170751322/-0.1118157512402 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">Passepartout, Leslie and I walked to The Oval. It looked as if it was the first ground in England to host international Test cricket in September 1880. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the home of the FA Cup final between 1874 and 1892! We visited the first ever international football match on 5 March 1870. Leslie and I admired the conference and events business. It was convenient for the ground and opening up views of the historic pavilion. Passepartout mourned it having been granted. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the bowler runs in, it's so quiet you can hear the creak of the gasometer." said Leslie. <!--visiting 51.482989719808/-0.11429620629162 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.481319434883/-0.11252023024736 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.478880530428/-0.1050657303908 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered Kennington Common. Imagine my surprise to learn it was a large area of common land mainly within the London Borough of Lambeth! I could see that it was notable for being one of the earliest venues for cricket within London. It functioned well as a market garden. Things changed after the end of the 18th century while fairs. <!--visiting 51.482269845816/-0.10631671757815 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.485179854432/-0.10625425544651 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Kennington tube station. I remembered it was opened on 18 December 1890 as part of London's first deep-level tube. It looked as if it was originally similar to the current arrangement at Borough. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't imagine a worse place for posters." said Passepartout. It was convenient for the lift. <!--visiting 51.487878912403/-0.10486771638904 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Royal Surrey Gardens. I remembered it was the site of Surrey Zoological Gardens and Surrey Music Hall. Imagine my surprise to learn it was acquired in 1831 by impresario Edward Cross to be the location of his new Surrey Zoological Gardens! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't imagine a worse place for large public entertainments from 1837." said Passepartout. <!--visiting 51.488157277629/-0.10126271913441 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.489337688153/-0.095800543249132 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.486472408804/-0.097774342320007 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 51.482134715579/-0.084559555288229 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 51.472489676278/-0.084796809641452 at speed 0.016--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Camberwell College of Arts. I could see that it was appointed head of the school's Painting Department. As far as I knew, this was Head of Painting in the early 1960s. Passepartout remembered it becoming an independent charity. Passepartout and I admired the purpose built community art and exhibition space. It was handy for cultural and educational activity in Peckham. <!--visiting 51.473467286271/-0.079719463012617 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.472831825311/-0.067972300797244 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.466954940714/-0.066142385791636 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 51.467713067523/-0.051882987353138 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  made our way to Queens Road Peckham railway station and caught a train, alighting near West Norwood Cemetery. Passepartout told me it was also known as the South Metropolitan Cemetery. My guidebook claimed it was founded by its own Act of Parliament of 1836 and consecrated for its first burials in 1837. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a high density of neoclassical architecture. Passepartout recalled the time before it was interred there himself. <!--visiting 51.432275171977/-0.09731107015097 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to West Norwood railway station. I could see that it was renamed on 1 January 1886 by the London. Imagine my surprise to learn it was due to an influx of new residents who objected to the "lower" suffix being applied! We noted an influx of new residents who objected to the "lower" suffix being applied. <!--visiting 51.431076104778/-0.10281009007307 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">Moving on, we arrived at South Circular Road, London. It was clearly originally a proposed new build route across South London in the 1920s. I recalled it was under construction by 1921. I admired the adverse effect on the traffic flow. Things changed after the roundabout junction with Rochester Way. We moved on, unsure what to make of compulsory purchasing of properties. <!--visiting 51.439775826079/-0.10911038261916 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.438450439711/-0.10352203956157 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.440548848871/-0.10194621676116 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 51.435417812724/-0.088252866286247 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Dulwich College. Imagine my surprise to learn it was founded in 1619 by Edward Alleyn! I could see that it was used colloquially from that date. Passepartout remarked that it didn't last long in this form. Passepartout remembered it becoming the home of the Master of the College. It was hard to believe it was ever part of the film set for the Tomb Raider film. Things were different after it was moved to its new (and current) premises in East Dulwich in 1887. We met Charles, an old friend and terrible bore who was passing by. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Short tunic buttoned to the chin, trousers of an Oxford mixture, an ordinary rifle cap with a broad band and narrow peak, and a dark coloured Inverness cape for winter." said Charles. We encounted some problems with their particular impact on college life. <!--visiting 51.439572374047/-0.08431402589482 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Dulwich Picture Gallery. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was opened to the public in 1817. It looked as if it was made an independent charitable trust in 1994. We enjoyed the famous innovative Education programme.

It looked as if it was known as "Dulwich College Preparatory School". Unless I was very much mistaken, this was reopened and run along with the school in Cranbrook. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a camp for the troops?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you ask, I am not so sure."

I recalled it was constructed in the mid-1950s among the ruins of the Crystal Palace. It looked as if it was destroyed in 1941 during the demolition of the Palace's north water tower. Passepartout commented that it didn't transmit analogue Channel 5: this (alone) came from Croydon. We enjoyed of the construction by BICC at the time which was available on loan from the BICC Film Library. We admired the total height of 708 ft. It seemed quite suitable for FM radio transmission of local radio stations BBC London 94. We made full benefit of high power ITV and BBC services for the whole of their region. Things were different after the construction of One Canada Square at Canary Wharf in 1991. <!--visiting 51.423439789548/-0.074313235987961 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Upper Sydenham railway station, we approached Crystal Palace Park. I could see that it was in turn named after The Crystal Palace which had been moved from Hyde Park. It was clearly forced to relocate during the First World War. It seemed quite suitable for cultural and sporting events. I tripped over the National Sports Centre which includes an athletic stadium. It was handy for the park became possible when the Crystal Palace railway station opened in 1854. Charles explained how it had been designed to represent the British Empire. Things were different after the club was forced to relocate during the First World War.

I remembered it was opened in 1964 in Crystal Palace Park. If I remembered correctly, this was used here between 1895 and 1914. Charles and I admired the folded teak lining. It was certainly handy for the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre that is also located in the park. Times certainly changed after they moved to the brand new Copper Box in 2013. We moved on, avoiding their failure to obtain the Olympic Stadium. <!--visiting 51.418355563898/-0.068118993125264 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing a main road, we approached Crystal Palace railway station. To the best of my recollection, this was moved from Hyde Park to Sydenham Hill after 1851. It looked as if it was the terminus of a spur line from Sydenham. We thought it was powered by gravity. It seemed handy for all platforms of the station. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to imitate the central section of the Crystal Palace. <!--visiting 51.417473569082/-0.071912760506491 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">A few streets away was Penge West railway station. If I remembered correctly, this was opened by the London and Croydon Railway in 1839. It was clearly only around 270 at this time. It was certainly handy for these buildings and sidings which served a coal yard and timber yard on the site of the old brickfield. Things were never the same after April 2005 when it was damaged in a fire set by arsonists. <!--visiting 51.416672931035/-0.064113817006786 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we ran to Anerley railway station. It looked as if it was in turn replaced by two shelters on the Up platform. I could see that it was opened originally as Annerley by the London and Croydon Railway in 1839.

As far as I knew, this was established in 1955 and initially used a small lattice tower. Passepartout asked me if it was originally used to broadcast the London ITV signal on VHF Band III, but I did not know. Passepartout commented that it wasn't used for regular TV broadcasting until 1997. It functioned well as a backup for Crystal Palace for the BBC A & B and Digital 3&4 multiplexes. Charles explained how it had been designed to avoid interference with continental transmitters. <!--visiting 51.408976580774/-0.085109590973539 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Selhurst Park. I could see that it was bought from the Brighton Railway Company for £2&comma;570. Passepartout asked me if it was constructed by Humphreys of Kensington (a firm regularly used by Leitch) for around £30&comma;000, but I did not know. Passepartout observed that it didn't include naming rights and the ground continued to be known as Selhurst Park. Passepartout mourned it having been roofed and made all-seater in the summer of 1993. <!--visiting 51.397611413333/-0.084863579996083 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Norwood Junction railway station. Charles told us a long story about  each forming an individual headshunt. I remembered it was given parliamentary authority to test an experimental atmospheric railway system on the railway. Imagine my surprise to learn it was built on Portland Road to create a vacuum in a continuous pipe located centrally between the rails! Charles remembered it becoming Norwood Junction by 1856. It functioned well as a private house until the 1960s. It seemed handy for all platforms. <!--visiting 51.396476741408/-0.074309422698528 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to South Norwood Leisure Centre. Passepartout asked me if it was shelved in favour of redeveloping the existing site, but I did not know. If I remembered correctly, this was underway when the 2006 local elections led to a change of political control of the Council. It seemed perfect for modernising facilities elsewhere. I found and admired a 25m sized swimming pool with seating for spectators. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand the disappointment but Croydon can't afford to build a new leisure centre." said Charles. <!--visiting 51.392876622716/-0.066810029285449 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.391957352082/-0.059224008627445 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.394892784546/-0.047153095995869 at speed 0.004--><p class="new">Passepartout flagged down a bus to Birkbeck station.

Imagine my amazement to learn it was constructed in 1965 on the site of the former Shirley Park Hotel! I could see that it was itself a development of a Georgian mansion called Shirley House. We joined some tourists who were admiring the co-educational Sixth Form. We enjoyed the famous outstanding musical achievements.

Passepartout told me it was built in 1788 and underwent several name changes. I could see that it was for 'orphan boys and others of the upper classes in every kind of distress'. Passepartout remembered it becoming the property of Father Tooth.

We agreed it was their home into the next century.

Passepartout asked me if it was a former school in the London Borough of Croydon, but I did not know.

It looked as if it was founded in 1892 and played friendly games against mainly local opposition sides in its first season. I remembered it was won at the first attempt.

Passepartout told me it was chosen following a competition where Bromley residents were asked for suggestions. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was chosen reflecting the history of Bromley as a wooded area! Passepartout observed that it wasn't renovated or rebranded to Sports Direct as the lease could have sold to another company at any time. I admired the total of 135 stores trading from a combined floorspace of 464000 sqft. It seemed perfect for many years. It seemed handy for both the Glades and the High Street; however. We took advantage of any indicator of the formerly strongly rural nature of most of Bromley. We moved on, unsure what to make of low sales and later opened a store in The Mall in Bromley. <!--visiting 51.403462658471/0.017475520147673 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to The Mall (Bromley). Unless I was very much mistaken, this was there before The Mall opened. I could see that it was wholly occupied by British Gas showroom. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't extended but the 1st floors were made smaller and raised. Robert explained to us how it had been designed to have a large balcony overlooking the lower floor and windows from floor to ceiling however only sevenoaks furniture use unit 4 in the way these units were designed to be used. <!--visiting 51.401662824225/0.017975701025853 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Bromley Palace.

Passepartout observed that it didn't cover a larger space than two acres.

Unless I was very much mistaken, this was a moated medieval manor house in Bromley. My guidebook said it was demolished around 1870 but survives in the name of a (minor) local road - Simpson's Place. Passepartout whispered it was rumoured to have been square in shape with fortified crenellated walls surrounded on all sides by a deep moat. Times certainly changed after the death of another Sir Humphrey Style in 1659. At this point, Robert entered a nearby house and bade us farewell.

I could see that it was given to Edward II in 1305 by the Bishop of Durham. It functioned well as a royal residence from the 14th to the 16th century.

Passepartout said that he didn't suit his lifestyle. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a communal dining room?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. It seemed quite similar to other Neo-Gothic buildings of the period. Passepartout disapproved of it being too emotional for him. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life is short, but art endures." said James. <!--visiting 51.454795273915/0.13092736838423 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Danson House.

It was clearly created an urban district in 1920 from part of Dartford Rural District. <!--visiting 51.449233446508/0.18397426217671 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.446767184897/0.17988470925127 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to VCD Athletic F.C.. My guidebook told me it was formed in 1916 by workers at the Vickers armaments factory at Crayford. I recalled it was now called the Kent County League. Passepartout observed that it wasn't up to the desired standard of the Isthmian league. We admired the capacity of 1180. <!--visiting 51.455181208691/0.1700706070952 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.454349856616/0.17124551026901 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.455877972941/0.17294694493344 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 51.450658028476/0.19440402447858 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We doubled back to Phoenix Sports F.C. and arranged passage on the next boat. Some time later, it docked near Dartford Grammar School for Girls and we walked the rest of the way. It looked as if it was formed on 27 June 1913. I remembered it was increased and temporary huts were placed in the school grounds for dining facilities. I admired the second specialism in Maths and Computing. <!--visiting 51.442630483097/0.20462862644479 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.430963650332/0.20516937026034 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I walked to The Mick Jagger Centre. It was clearly a pupil at the school. Imagine my surprise to learn it was funded by a National Lottery grant of £1! We joined some tourists who were admiring the capacity of 150 seated; the Big Room can seat 350 or hold 600 standing. <!--visiting 51.444229757384/0.20619413519703 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.440271500904/0.20471789691695 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Wilmington Grammar School for Boys.

I recalled it was occupied by apple orchards in the 17th century. It looked as if it was established before the Whitehead family took over the manor house. We visited the English department. I admired the close relationship with the next-door Wilmington Grammar School for Boys. <!--visiting 51.430033514382/0.19434226147094 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.42646765856/0.19528527417698 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.403144352049/0.20028078635007 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 51.41050207187/0.23843212690653 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 51.389268608614/0.24644710298482 at speed 0.016--><!--visiting 51.391929682977/0.2702997899754 at speed 0.032--><p class="new">We parked near Longfield railway station. Imagine my amazement to learn it was chosen as a local land owner had offered land and cash for provision of a station! Unless I was thinking of something else, this was destroyed by fire around 1900.

(Kent). Passepartout asked me if it was founded in 1972 by Ron Billings to provide football in a safe environment, but I did not know. It was clearly simply "pro omnium beneficio"- for the benefit of all. Things were different after they finished bottom and were relegated to the Kent League in 1991. <!--visiting 51.382432537839/0.29461938034423 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of Brands Hatch. Imagine my surprise to learn it was designed and constructed by four-times British Rallycross Champion Trevor Hopkins! It was clearly originally the name of a natural grassy hollow that was shaped like a amphitheatre. Passepartout observed that it wasn't yet dead as it was run as the feature event for the Daily Telegraph Trophy. We admired the curfew of 18:30 due to a housing estate built near to Clearways bend. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a dirt track motorcycle circuit on farmland?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. I could hardly hear Passepartout over the sound of the sports car. Passepartout mourned it having been run over 103 laps - 269 miles - which Jacky Ickx and Jochen Mass won at 97. Things changed after 08:30 and must be turned off by 18:30. We noted the straight that precedes it. <!--visiting 51.355899089104/0.26314107378868 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.358453441892/0.30126739740903 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.380247580615/0.26921189115563 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 51.381863790444/0.23873235045605 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Lullingstone Roman Villa. It was clearly repeatedly expanded and occupied until it was destroyed by fire in the 5th century. I could see that it was destroyed by fire in the 5th century. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really the country retreat of the governors of the Roman province of Britannia?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I said. Passepartout examined the only known Christian paintings from the Roman era in Britain. Passepartout whispered it was rumoured to have been converted to Christian use. The mood here changed after it was destroyed by fire in the 5th century. <!--visiting 51.363241521176/0.197051697686 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled to Lullingstone. It was clearly a Civil Parish until 1955. If I remembered correctly, this was in Axstane Hundred and its successor Dartford Rural District. Did it entice bombers to misinterpret it as Biggin Hill? We were not sure. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to some of the finest excavated remains of a Roman villa in Britain. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the castle!" said Passepartout. <!--visiting 51.357372759902/0.19383313661214 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.330493588186/0.19031556962863 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.309992178194/0.19963716365287 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 51.283912994105/0.1995062001861 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather was worsening, so we  made our way to Bat & Ball railway station and caught an express train, alighting near Knole House. My guidebook told me it was constructed beginning in the late 15th century. I remembered it was executed after the victory of Jack Cade's rebels at the Battle of Solefields. Passepartout observed that it didn't extend to the gate-house. We admired the very large walled garden. I spent a few minutes examining many other features from earlier ages which have been taken out of most country-house gardens: various landscapers have been employed to elaborate the design of its large gardens with distinctive features. It was within convenient distance of all parts. We met Thomas, a college friend of mine who had heard about our journey. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being for the Benefit of Mr&period; Kite!" exclaimed Thomas. <!--visiting 51.265253069782/0.20666490243654 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Sevenoaks School. Passepartout told me it was a pioneer in attracting international students during the 1960s. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was opened on the school campus. Passepartout remembered it becoming the first major UK school to switch entirely from A level exams to the International Baccalaureate. At this point, Thomas had to leave, saying that they had to return to Knole House. <!--visiting 51.264254899493/0.19566695219786 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Sevenoaks railway station. It was clearly opened on 2 March 1868. Passepartout asked me if it was formerly known as "Tubs Hill", but I did not know. We avoided poor financial management (although their train operating performance had been very poor). <!--visiting 51.275644276785/0.18233416618735 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Vine Cricket Ground. I remembered it was given to the town of Sevenoaks in 1773 by John Frederick Sackville. As far as I knew, this was played with three stumps rather than two. It functioned well as a vineyard for the Archbishops of Canterbury (hence the name). <!--visiting 51.27484641302/0.19465151219083 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.289328402722/0.20327914142103 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.28239419658/0.22153871201927 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 51.290940728775/0.25222352679976 at speed 0.008--><p class="new">We made our way to Kemsing railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Ightham Mote. It was clearly completely enclosed by increments on its restricted moated site. Unless I was mistaken, this was constructed in the 15th century. It was convenient for a closet. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to enable a gatekeeper to examine a visitor's credentials before opening the gate. Things changed after the mid-19th century when the line faltered with Elizabeth Selby. <!--visiting 51.257544424073/0.26920506107985 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.278484500479/0.26130649584848 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.283034171149/0.27194249582473 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 51.28687253328/0.31078335995246 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Wrotham transmitting station. It looked as if it was built to replace the original mast of equal height that was constructed in 1951. Unless I was mistaken, this was the first station in the UK to broadcast on VHF/FM. Passepartout remembered it becoming the first BBC transmitter to broadcast in stereo. It seemed a fine spot for these programmes on FM in 1955 are still in use today. <!--visiting 51.319833260137/0.28844195792904 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.331675389492/0.24939443532059 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.334157756013/0.27229302930298 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 51.29385995974/0.31512834335872 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a coach near Addington Long Barrow.

Passepartout said it was thought to have been a male-dominated society. <!--visiting 51.307135168002/0.37077247226147 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus not too far from West Malling railway station. Passepartout asked me if it was renamed West Malling on 23 May 1949, but I did not know. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was withdrawn some years ago. We took advantage of a regular link to/from Kings Hill (some journeys via West Malling) on Mondays to Fridays (not late evening). <!--visiting 51.291216377953/0.41962146484905 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.284428302158/0.44023683705209 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked not too far from Aylesford railway station.

Things changed after the privatisation of British Railways. <!--visiting 51.300546227986/0.46662255739167 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  walked to Aylesford railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Medway Megaliths. To the best of my knowledge, this was a revolutionary period of British history. It looked as if it was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't directly connected to the long mound. Passepartout remembered it becoming a scheduled ancient monument. We agreed it was subject to further damage through ploughing. We enjoyed a plan of the site in 1871. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was tombs for the remains of a select group of individuals?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. It seemed handy for both the Addington Longbarrow and The Chestnuts burial chamber. Passepartout whispered it was thought to have been a male-dominated society. We met Richard, an old friend of mine who was passing by. We ignored an intentional program of destruction in the late 13th century CE. <!--visiting 51.31586757525/0.50060120510697 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard drove us to High Speed 1. Passepartout asked me if it was awarded the "Major Project Award" at the British Construction Industry Awards, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was transferred to government ownership in 2009. Passepartout commented that it didn't take place as it was not financially viable. We admired the maximum speed of 225 km/h. Things were different after a point approximately 1 mi from St&period; Pancras. We encounted some problems with its own financial problems. <!--visiting 51.326198427879/0.5065983336481 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.31436143661/0.50261201619099 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Coffin Stone.

My guidebook told me it was a now lost member of the group of Neolithic chamber tombs in the English county of Kent. To the best of my knowledge, this was possibly investigated in 1844 and was still extant in the early twentieth century. It was hard to believe it was ever a source of stone to metal new roads. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the skeleton of a man and fragments of red pottery were found although none of these has since survived. <!--visiting 51.334169314304/0.49704908464899 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.331736391469/0.48453740114795 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Buckmore Park Kart Circuit. Passepartout asked me if it was originally discovered by Ron Dennis in the 1996 Champions of the Future Event held at Buckmore Park, but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was added to the roster of events! We enjoyed the legendary Hire Kart Club which regularly hosts events for its members. We avoided the scouts not having enough money to maintain it. <!--visiting 51.342253350871/0.50198572465605 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Fort Bridgewood. I could see that it was mounted; instead earthen ramps were built to enable field artillery to fire from the fort's parapet. As far as I knew, this was a radical departure from traditional design. I recalled the Borstal Institution system of correction of the same name. We noted its deep dry moat design. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for Civil Defence preparation and training." said Passepartout. Richard explained how it had been designed to blend in with the line of the land. Things were never the same after the outbreak of the First World War. <!--visiting 51.358918913203/0.49504010332663 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to HM Prison Cookham Wood.

It looked as if it was a fort built between 1805 and 1819 on the high ground of the boundary between Chatham and Rochester. As far as I knew, this was founded there in 1860. Passepartout observed that it didn't last long because it became a hospital for invalid soldiers in 1828.

It was clearly the defence of the Naval Dockyard. Passepartout asked me if it was then acquired by two Acts of Parliament in 1708 and 1709, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a training-ground during the Victorian era?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally."

My guidebook told me it was selected as the first Director with the rank of major. I remembered it was surrounded by batteries. Passepartout observed that it wasn't achieved until 1850 when the training Depot was moved to Brompton Barracks. Richard remembered it becoming the Royal Engineers' Establishment. We enjoyed in bronze and is awarded to the top student in each of the Clerk of Works (Construction). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for the construction of Alexandra Palace." said Passepartout. We helped ourselves to a wide range of training not only in all the engineering disciplines that are fundamental to the Royal Engineers. Richard explained how it had been designed to be defended by 7000 men and so provided excellent areas for training in siege operations. The mood here changed after the late 19th century and were sporadically occupied during the First and Second World Wars. We encounted some problems with the difficulty of finding suitable workshops elsewhere. <!--visiting 51.38702927322/0.52533504061614 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Chatham Naval Memorial. My guidebook told me it was in its own right a layer of defence to protect Chatham Dockyard from attack. It looked as if it was dedicated as the site of one of three memorials to sailors. I admired the stepped top to an elaborate finial with corner ships prows and bronze supports to a ball. I spent a while examining 10&comma;098 additional names from the later conflict. <!--visiting 51.382798092513/0.5328063158609 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Medway Maritime Hospital. I could see that it was founded as the Royal Naval Hospital in 1902 for the Naval personnel at the Chatham Dockyard. Unless I was mistaken, this was almost 1&comma;000 feet long. Passepartout observed that it wasn't large enough to deal with the increasing numbers of Naval personnel moving into Chatham. We admired the large Grade II Listed water tower / Chimney. <!--visiting 51.379187238286/0.54252703625456 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.384940095299/0.5510459530262 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.380075967621/0.55232154912389 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Priestfield Stadium. Passepartout asked me if it was also the temporary home of Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club for two seasons during the 1990s, but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was acquired by the club's founders! Passepartout and I enjoyed a glossy brochure as part of its bid to be elected back into the league. It seemed perfect for other events. I spent a while examining the changing rooms. It seemed handy for the pitch. Passepartout recounted how it had been settled out of court in 2001. The mood here changed after the latter stages of the 1999-2000 season. We avoided talk of relocating the club to a new ground and the club's current financial problems. <!--visiting 51.383433917145/0.56133071492234 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">With no time to lose, we travelled to Jezreel's tower. Richard told me it was a prophet and her sealed writings purported to reveal answers to world problems. If I remembered correctly, this was the imminent coming of a second Christ (Shiloh) of whom she -- aged 65 -- was to be the mother. Passepartout remarked that it didn't apply to the leader. Was it a sanctuary? We thought not. We enjoyed the famous product. Richard explained how it had been designed to rise under hydraulic pressure to a height of 30 ft. Things were different after its complete demolition in 1961. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the city lieth foursquare, and the length thereof is as great as the breadth..." said Richard. <!--visiting 51.373629495594/0.55169258880336 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.365036517409/0.56782537726624 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Chatham Grammar School for Girls.

Passepartout commented that it wasn't until 1872 that the Treasury relented and the land was purchased. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a Transit Barracks for troops en route to Europe?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you ask, I am not so sure."

I could see that it was formed in 1882 as Chatham United. I remembered it was prompted when the club reached the quarter-finals of the FA cup in 1888-89. Things were different after former player John Adams became First Team manager.

We admired the 4 form system. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was an exam room and Sixth Form study area?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. Things were different after the following Easter of Year 13.

I could see that it was formed in 1990 after three local schools were closed. I remembered it was taken under the authority of the newly formed Medway LEA. At this point, Richard had to leave, saying that they had to return to Medway Megaliths. <!--visiting 51.363695016778/0.50299329757473 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">We wandered a short distance to Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School. To the best of my knowledge, this was founded by the 17th-century politician Sir Joseph Williamson. Unless I was mistaken, this was originally in Rochester High Street. Passepartout remarked that it didn't know part of the old city wall with a small tower ran through the school buildings. Passepartout and I admired the series of classrooms for the use of pupils throughout the school.

Passepartout asked me if it was life-expired and demolished in early 2013, but I did not know. Passepartout took notes on the standard pre-fabricated design built at the Southern Railway's concrete factory at Exmouth Junction. It was certainly handy for Platform 1. We took advantage of information relating to train running times for both platforms. <!--visiting 51.284207837503/0.47961050487668 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.291210221746/0.49241350941655 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost, we  made our way to Barming railway station and caught a train, alighting near Maidstone Grammar School for Girls. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was founded in 1887 by the Wardens and Assistants of Rochester Bridge!

It looked as if it was opened as Maidstone by the London. It seemed quite suitable for that purpose. Did it build a large Waitrose supermarket on the site? We were not sure. We took advantage of a route to the Medway Valley Line's Maidstone Barracks station on the west of the river. We noted their development of a site at the nearby St Peters' Street complex instead. <!--visiting 51.277202055997/0.52160292042166 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Maidstone United F.C.. It was clearly a member of The Football League between 1989 and 1992. Passepartout said it was built around the youth squad. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for away shirts." said Passepartout. He mourned it having been put up for sale by chairman Paul Bowden-Brown. Things changed after a lease for the site was agreed with its owners. We moved on, avoiding a sharp drop in attendances. <!--visiting 51.279202748092/0.51643697674683 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.275712314727/0.51529777116966 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Maidstone Barracks railway station, we approached Hazlitt Theatre. Unless I was mistaken, this was named after William Hazlitt. My guidebook claimed it was born in Maidstone in 1778. We visited the Hazlitt Youth Theatre (HYT). We took advantage of opportunities for young people aged between 6 and 18 to put on productions. We encounted some problems with an alien invasion. <!--visiting 51.273202659678/0.52160352995841 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Maidstone West railway station. I could see that it was bypassed when the South Eastern Main Line opened by the South Eastern Railway (SER) in 1842. It looked as if it was opened from Paddock Wood to Maidstone West. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was the point at which the mileage measurements and the "Up" and "Down" directions to London change?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so."

I could see that it was first chosen by the then incumbent South of England ITV company Southern Television in 1979. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was an independent production facility?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. Things were never the same after Southern ceased broadcasting at the end of 1981. <!--visiting 51.278581633632/0.54926483181213 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to HM Prison Maidstone.

I could see that it was a founder member of the Museums Association (1909). Passepartout asked me if it was added to the west of the Tudor house, but I did not know. I spent a few minutes examining over 600&comma;000 artefacts and specimens. It was handy for some parts of the Museum difficult. <!--visiting 51.275035637022/0.52115888822758 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to spare, we walked to Fremlin Walk.

Unless I was mistaken, this was converted to landscaped park land at the end of the 18th century before becoming a municipal park. It looked as if it was used as one of the earliest deer parks in Kent. We visited the Caldecott Community (now the Caldecott Foundation). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a cricket ground for the Kent County Cricket Club?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"See for yourself." I said. Passepartout was unimpressed by a number of recreation facilities (see below). Passepartout spoke of the time when it was used as offices for the Ministry of Agriculture.

As far as I could remember, this was part of the civil parish of Otham. It looked as if it was recorded in the Domesday Book on the River Len. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't until around 1550. We made full benefit of the best cross section through a series of cambers and gulls that are currently visible in Britain and is a site of special scientific interest.

We admired the large danger area marked on maps south of Lydd towards the sea. We made full benefit of an appropriate environment for counter-terrorism and civil disorder training. The mood here changed after the completion of the Royal Military Canal in 1806. At this point, Paul entered a nearby pub and bade us farewell.

Passepartout observed that it didn't materialise. I admired the exceptionally good safety record. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for loading coal into loco tenders." said Passepartout. It seemed handy for the car park extension along the former platform 4 and engine release siding. Things changed after it was named after the line's founder.

Things were never the same after the death of the eccentric William Tourney Tourney (the last Lord of Brockhill Manor) in 1903. <!--visiting 51.081134137174/1.0655002814872 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.088266537008/1.0669972693224 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.096517343938/1.0853008428345 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Operation Stack. Unless I was mistaken, this was first introduced in February 1988. I remembered it was then an important ferry terminal. We agreed it was supported by development in the Stanford and Lympne areas. It seemed handy for cross-channel services is restricted. Passepartout disapproved of it being sited; he accused the county council of "not thinking strategically". We avoided industrial action taken by French employees of the MyFerryLink company. <!--visiting 51.091728532733/1.0928904536709 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.105756838585/1.0856805040951 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Saltwood Castle. Passepartout told me it was hatched to assassinate Thomas Becket (1118-1170). My guidebook said it was probably erected on a Roman site. Passepartout remembered it becoming the home of the art historian Lord Clark of Saltwood (1903-1983). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a residence ever since?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. Passepartout whispered it was believed to have been erected on a Roman site. Things changed after the reign of Henry VIII when Hythe and Saltwood were seized by the Crown. <!--visiting 51.080975222905/1.0848613039553 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered Saltwood Miniature Railway. Unless I was mistaken, this was a gauge miniature railway which first opened in Sheffield. Passepartout asked me if it was an important part of community life in Saltwood, but I did not know. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to protect the engines from a direct hit by a German bomb. <!--visiting 51.07829859516/1.0802186533507 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Centuries, Hythe. Imagine my surprise to learn it was built in the 13th century! I could see that it was used for storage and trade while the ground floor and first floor were living areas. Passepartout remembered it becoming St&period; Bartholomew's Hospital. It seemed quite suitable for storage and trade while the ground floor and first floor were living areas. <!--visiting 51.070966582219/1.0838299730331 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.063235417915/1.0562919783012 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.052670441107/1.0325486708824 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 51.065353640042/1.0277330374118 at speed 0.008--><p class="new">Our train arrived near Port Lympne Wild Animal Park. Passepartout told me it was purchased in 1973 by John Aspinall to solve lack of space at Howletts Wild Animal Park. If I remembered correctly, this was opened to the public in 1976. We visited the UK's largest herd of African elephants. We enjoyed a stillborn calf and also perished. Passepartout was unimpressed by the endangered crowned sifaka and the largest breeding herd of black rhinoceros outside Africa. <!--visiting 51.075256692725/0.99996446118401 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.093274817445/1.0390118029211 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout told me about Folkestone Racecourse. I remembered it was a thoroughbred horse racing venue in southeast England. Imagine my surprise to learn it was owned by King Canute! We admired the reservoir fed by a pumping station on the west side of the oval. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a decoy airfield with dummy aircraft placed to look like an active airfield?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I said. <!--visiting 51.093027141011/1.0341184448798 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.098551540833/1.0390655591774 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.091544929184/1.047015560879 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Westenhanger Castle. I recalled it was a fortified 14th century quadrangular manor house reflecting the opulence of its owners at that time. It looked as if it was initially responsible in 1343 for the building of a permanent structure on the site. I admired the rich history with royalty and nobility. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a conference and wedding venue?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I said. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was established at Jamestown. <!--visiting 51.09358284882/1.0318967712791 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.068286044596/1.0199201722987 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to 1965 Skyways Coach-Air Avro 748 crash. Passepartout asked me if it was due to the grass runway being unable to support the weight of the aircraft during a heavy landing, but I did not know. It was clearly the first accident involving the Avro 748/HS 748 that resulted in a write-off. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't strapped in. We avoided the grass runway being unable to support the weight of the aircraft during a heavy landing. <!--visiting 51.082475510924/1.0171806217804 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Port Lympne Mansion. Passepartout asked me if it was bequeathed with its contents, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was abandoned after the Second World War. I admired the coroneted B on his trunk. It seemed perfect for the gardens comes from natural springs. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to ensure there is natural fresh water for the gardens throughout the summer. We entered into conversation with a passer-by, who introduced themselves as Norah. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rex now hit on the right treatment." said Norah. <!--visiting 51.074795887676/1.0001000885861 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.073087645248/1.0011402365608 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.069671184447/1.0032205720133 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 51.062838222127/1.0073811760472 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down not too far from Burmarsh Road railway station. Passepartout asked me if it was then called Burmarsh for East Dymchurch and was equipped with two platforms, but I did not know. It was clearly equipped with two platforms. Passepartout recounted how it had been reduced in status to a halt and again renamed as Burmarsh Road Halt. <!--visiting 51.035149289273/1.0047256341493 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near St Mary's Bay railway station. My guidebook told me it was able to be used as such until 2000. It looked as if it was unusual in a non-block station. It functioned well as such until 2000. I found and admired the control equipment for the adjacent level crossing. Things were different after the end of 2000 when it was renamed "Jefferstone Lane". <!--visiting 51.01065722538/0.97503826660628 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.014144932453/0.98079428050278 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 50.981356673425/0.95529594339935 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 50.949275735258/0.95857003623167 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed the site of The Pilot Inn railway station. I recalled it was a station on the Romney. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was a temporary terminus whilst construction of the remaining section of track to Dungeness continued. Norah remembered it becoming necessary to reduce the Dungeness line to single-track. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was staff accommodation?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. <!--visiting 50.92726731946/0.97372375366239 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Dungeness Nuclear Power Station. I could see that it was connected to the National Grid in 1965 and has reached the end of its life. It was clearly undertaken by a consortium known as the Nuclear Power Group ('TNPG'). Passepartout commented that it didn't include Dungeness C in its draft National Policy Statement published on 9 November 2009. We moved on, disappointed by corrosion and vibration concerns. <!--visiting 50.913059831854/0.96444799927165 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 50.912739047758/0.97151410845535 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed the site of Lade railway station.

Passepartout remarked that it wasn't even provided with hard platform surfaces. Was it a major station? We were not sure. <!--visiting 50.947476285554/0.96590219581863 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">Norah told me about Britannia Points Halt railway station.

I recalled it was a railway station which served the Dungeness headland in Kent. Passepartout said it was the terminus of the Lydd Railway Company's branch from Appledore which opened on 7 December 1881. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was holiday shacks?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally."

It was clearly established in 1885 and entered the South Eastern (Ashford) League. I remembered it was accepted into the newly formed Kent Invicta Football League for the inaugural 2011-12 season. Things changed after they entered the Kent County Football League in 1959. We noted a restructuring of the Kent County League system. <!--visiting 50.943555112362/0.90925736892629 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Lydd Town railway station. Passepartout asked me if it was a railway station which served the town of Lydd in Kent, but I did not know. If I remembered correctly, this was the father of Alfred Mellor Watkin. It functioned well as a vehicle repair workshop until the mid-1980s which saw some internal walls removed. It seemed handy for Lydd Airport - the plans have never materialised.

Things were never the same after the renovated Parc des Princes was inaugurated in 1972.

We made full benefit of tutoring. <!--visiting 48.892189317568/2.3019196345609 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.884942915512/2.2952689603144 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 48.876276281096/2.3023186025544 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 48.875688245146/2.311370874365 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 48.866884171824/2.3289497389886 at speed 0.016--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Place Vendôme. Imagine my surprise to learn it was erected by Napoleon I to commemorate the battle of Austerlitz; it was torn down on 16 May 1871! Passepartout said it was torn down on 16 May 1871. Passepartout observed that it didn't materialize. Passepartout looked up at the statue of Victory (mythology), the personified goddess of victory. The sculptor had captured the temple on the Palatine Hill perfectly. To think that somebody who was the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess Nike should have such a statue in Place Vendôme. <!--visiting 48.867044757166/2.3303346187484 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Hôtel Ritz Paris. I remembered it was founded by the Swiss hotelier. It looked as if it was constructed behind the façade of an 18th-century town house. I admired the glittering Regency formality that seems to swirl around you. I spent a few minutes studying Louis XV furniture and a portrait of Ritz himself. <!--visiting 48.867328949729/2.3295047270254 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.868055139477/2.3328140393805 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Avenue de l'Opéra. Passepartout asked me if it was created from 1864 to 1879 as part of Haussmann's renovation of Paris, but I did not know. It was clearly an important thoroughfare in Hausmann's traffic scheme. Passepartout commented that it didn't want the view to be obstructed by the leaves and branches. Passepartout remembered it becoming the Paris field office of the United States Secret Service. We enjoyed by the leveling of this hill was used to fill the excavations of the Champ de Mars. It was within convenient distance of the wealthy neighbourhoods being developed at that time in northwest Paris. <!--visiting 48.866622261852/2.3346688471149 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.864877722123/2.3364064862842 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to spare, we walked to Conseil d'État (France). My guidebook claimed it was the Conseil d'État privé. Passepartout commented that it didn't respect human dignity. We took advantage of a powerful check on the actions of the executive. Things were different after the case is ready for final judgment. <!--visiting 48.86289657674/2.3378440213415 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">We wandered to Palais Royal – Musée du Louvre (Paris Métro). Passepartout told me it was the southern terminus of the line until it was extended to Pont Marie on 16 April 1926. He asked me if it was extended to Pont Marie on 16 April 1926, but I did not know. Things were never the same after it was extended to Pont Marie on 16 April 1926. We bumped into a local shopkeeper, who introduced themselves as Jean-Michel. <!--visiting 48.862254983289/2.3374990362163 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to spare, we ran to Louvre. My guidebook claimed it was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. I recalled it was closed in 1796 until 1801. Passepartout remarked that it didn't correspond exactly to the modern site. We visited the former Tuileries Palace. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a museum to display the nation's masterpieces?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I said. I found and admired the coronation crown of Louis XIV. It was handy for the museum. Passepartout looked up at the statue of Amenemhatankh, an ancient Egyptian prince of the 12th dynasty. We ignored structural deficiencies. <!--visiting 48.860812415007/2.337343309978 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Louvre Pyramid. My guidebook claimed it was designed by the architect I&period; M&period; Pei. As far as I knew, this was constructed entirely with glass segments. I spent a short time studying 673 glass panes (603 rhombi and 70 triangles). It was handy for the pyramid and the Passage Richelieu. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I&period;M&period; Pei's plan distributes people effectively from the central concourse to myriad destinations within its vast subterranean network." said Jean-Michel. <!--visiting 48.860582693266/2.3367744929381 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Louvre Palace. Unless I was mistaken, this was the actual seat of power in France until Louis XIV moved to Versailles in 1682. If I remembered correctly, this was added to by almost every subsequent French monarch. Passepartout observed that it wasn't finished until the 19th century with the advent of Napoleon. Passepartout remembered it becoming an art gallery. Passepartout examined the celebrated Musée du Louvre as well as various government departments. Things changed after Louis XIV moved to Versailles in 1682. We couldn't fail to notice the statue of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, a key figure in the French Revolution of 1789 and the July Revolution of 1830. Passepartout thought the statue should have been wearing to not separate until a constitution was established. The sculptor had captured the joyous reunion with Washington at Morristown perfectly. We were impressed that somebody who was made a major general should have such a statue in Louvre Palace. <!--visiting 48.860812415007/2.337343309978 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.86021424335/2.3392517624059 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 48.85953422723/2.3439721016101 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Louvre – Rivoli (Paris Métro), we approached Pont Neuf. My guidebook claimed it was given to distinguish it from older bridges that were lined on both sides with houses. I remembered it was the heart of medieval Paris. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't a problem on the north side. Jean-Michel remembered it becoming busier. We noted its less ornate design. Passepartout looked up at the statue of Louis Charles Antoine Desaix, a French general and military leader. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"So central an artery is the Pont Neuf, that it used to be a saying with the Parisian police, that if, after watching three days, they did not see a man cross the bridge, he must have left Paris." said Jean-Michel. <!--visiting 48.857359645671/2.342612827988 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">The sky clouded over as we approached Conciergerie. Jean-Michel told me it was part of the former royal palace. It looked as if it was originally the site of a Merovingian palace. We agreed it was equipped with a rough bed and perhaps a table. It was hard to believe it was ever a dining room for the 2&comma;000 staff members who worked in the palace. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Conciergerie." said Jean-Michel. <!--visiting 48.856446486535/2.3465538999417 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.855755069471/2.3469423028445 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 48.856345850294/2.3490020518613 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Jean-Michel and I walked to Saint-Jacques Tower. I remembered it was built in 1509 to 1523. As far as I knew, this was a condition of the contract by which the church was bought for the value of its building materials. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't added by the 19th-century restorers. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a shot tower to make small shot?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you ask, I am not so sure." I said. We admired the statue of Blaise Pascal, a French mathematician. To think that somebody who was too unstable to be carried should have such a statue in Saint-Jacques Tower. <!--visiting 48.857386729446/2.3497273492284 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.856072506438/2.3501108564376 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville - Esplanade de la Libération. I remembered it was used as a public meeting-place and also as a location where unemployed people gathered to seek work. It was clearly the site of most of the public executions in early Paris. It functioned well as a public meeting-place and also as a location where unemployed people gathered to seek work. <!--visiting 48.85666656/2.35038893 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by was Siege of Paris (1870–71). It looked as if it was recalled to deal with French forces accompanied by Napoleon III. Unless I was mistaken, this was eventually driven back by artillery fire. Passepartout remembered it becoming clear shortly after the siege began. It seemed a fine spot for a pigeon post. Passepartout recounted how it had been driven back by artillery fire. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Frenchmen of 1870 are the sons of those Gauls for whom battles were holidays." said Jean-Michel. <!--visiting 48.8566/2.3508 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by was Hôtel de Ville, Paris. Unless I was mistaken, this was located in the so-called parloir aux bourgeois ("Parlour of Burgesses") near the Châtelet. I could see that it was torn down and Boccador. Passepartout observed that it wasn't finished until 1628 during the reign of Louis XIII. We thought it was worthy of Paris. We enjoyed the figure of the 18th-century mathematician Jean le Rond d'Alembert. <!--visiting 48.8567/2.3508 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearby was Battle of Paris (1814). It was clearly fought on March 30-31. I remembered it was retreating from his failed invasion of Russia in 1812. Passepartout observed that it wasn't enough to halt it in time. Things were never the same after the Prussian forces appeared to their rear. <!--visiting 48.857306273672/2.3525079389102 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Jean-Michel and I walked to Rue de Rivoli. Jean-Michel told us a long story about  the Place Vendôme. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was a pleasing uniformity! It looked as if it was wounded at the Saint-Honoré Gate in her unsuccessful attack on English-held Paris on September 8. We couldn't fail to notice the statue of Joan of Arc, he who gives us an exact date. The sculptor had captured the profound effect on their decisions since they often accepted the advice she gave them perfectly. It seemed fitting somebody who was born on the night of Epiphany should have such a statue in Rue de Rivoli. <!--visiting 48.857623191612/2.3543799114668 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">We wandered to Timeline of Paris. As far as I knew, this was buried in the Basilica of Saint-Denis. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the first college in Paris! Passepartout commented that it didn't become popular until 1669. We admired the scandal by giving a lecture inspired by Jean Calvin. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a sewer?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. Did it make censorship more effective? We were not sure. Jean-Michel explained how it had been designed to be the most modern theater in the world. Things were different after eleven in the evening in winter and midnight in summer. At this point, Jean-Michel entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. We noted the statue of Childebert I, a Frankish King of the Merovingian dynasty. We were impressed that somebody who was assassinated should have such a statue in Timeline of Paris. We had heard stories of the growing popularity of the beverage. <!--visiting 48.85737283363/2.3526523889519 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.858861339286/2.3547601063444 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I walked to Centre Georges Pompidou. Unless I was mistaken, this was officially opened on 31 January 1977 by President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. Passepartout said it was placed in 2012 in front of the Centre Pompidou. Passepartout observed that it didn't exist at this time. Passepartout and I enjoyed a documentary about the Centre. It seemed perfect for temporary exhibitions. Did it handle 8&comma;000 visitors a day? We were not sure. Passepartout examined the Bibliothèque publique d'information (Public Information Library). We noted the lack of a legal framework for a non-profit foreign institution to operate in China. <!--visiting 48.86135857092/2.3531195896508 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to spare, we walked to IRCAM. I could see that it was designed by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers. I remembered it was in charge of the centre. Passepartout took several photographs of the piece realized in this program by a composer with significant technological skill. We made full benefit of classes to train composers in music technology. <!--visiting 48.860605580516/2.3521058497588 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.862601478525/2.3548469433203 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered to Rue de Montmorency. It was clearly known between the end of the French Revolution and 1806 as the rue de la Réunion. If I remembered correctly, this was nominated by Anne of Austria Superintendent of Finance in 1653. I found and admired the Auberge Nicolas Flamel. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was rebuilt. <!--visiting 48.863761864679/2.3557085460288 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.867521443712/2.356695862798 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Conservatoire national des arts et métiers. Imagine my surprise to learn it was founded on 10 October 1794! Passepartout and I admired the large museum of inventions accessible to the public with over 250 000 visitors per year. We met William, an old friend of Passepartout's who was in the area. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"He (or it) teaches everyone everywhere." said William. <!--visiting 48.867649321652/2.3551537649302 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing a main road, we approached Théâtre de la Renaissance. Passepartout asked me if it was built that same year next to the Porte Saint-Martin at 20 boulevard Saint-Martin, but I did not know. If I remembered correctly, this was produced there in August 1839. Passepartout and I enjoyed in this theatre. Things were different after the arrival of Lucien Guitry from October 1902 until 1909. We moved on, disappointed by theatrical intrigues. <!--visiting 48.869731023715/2.3570981726279 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.871130767297/2.3553087472158 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Château d'Eau (Paris Métro). It was clearly known as the Place du Château d'Eau until 1879. Passepartout said it was replaced by the David Fountain. We admired the side platform configuration with two tracks. Things were different after it was replaced by the David Fountain. We had heard stories of the cut-and-cover nature of the Paris Métro. <!--visiting 48.873481924705/2.3568211665007 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.877518961217/2.3597538774127 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 48.879760137286/2.3620077699271 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 48.890032997396/2.3659792593369 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 48.895529191166/2.3800980513497 at speed 0.016--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down not too far from Porte de la Villette (Paris Métro). To the best of my knowledge, this was a Gallo-Roman village. My guidebook claimed it was called Villette-Saint-Miser-lez-Paris. William remembered it becoming Ville Neuve Saint-Ladre and by 1426 it was called Villette-Saint-Miser-lez-Paris. At this point, William reluctantly left us, saying that they had business to attend to back at Conservatoire national des arts et métiers. <!--visiting 48.897795082046/2.3865891257348 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.89574966501/2.3831637475318 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 48.894397975735/2.3799088400369 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 48.893516278057/2.3792553558694 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Riquet (Paris Métro), we approached Parc de la Villette. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was designed by Bernard Tschumi. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was in partial response to the philosophies of Jacques Derrida! We visited a large sculptural steel dragon that has an 80 ft slide for children to play on. We admired the collection of ten themed gardens that attract a large amount of the park's visitors. Passepartout took a photograph of the traditional park design such as New York City's Central Park. We took advantage of a truly honest relationship between the subject and the object. We avoided its roots in deconstructivism. <!--visiting 48.893761669419/2.3915408839205 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.895855627846/2.3900273861779 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 48.897268323449/2.392276386189 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 48.907303381167/2.3934547058597 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 48.925523065215/2.4151292690093 at speed 0.016--><!--visiting 48.929419468942/2.4723644800811 at speed 0.032--><!--visiting 48.965913527434/2.4560408320824 at speed 0.064--><!--visiting 48.966618778818/2.4567497894051 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.933437253812/2.4953907916734 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 48.936311720406/2.498172417421 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 48.961122620835/2.4380908817372 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 48.946585381575/2.4369419646758 at speed 0.016--><!--visiting 48.95343305598/2.44876618417 at speed 0.032--><p class="new">Our bus pulled up at PSA Aulnay-sous-Bois Plant.

Passepartout asked me if it was built for the demand of the coal industry to process the coal coming from the mines of Péronnes, but I did not know. <!--visiting 50.42842128603/4.1720555556516 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 50.480134574223/4.2017697285493 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 50.532550808685/4.2606822534214 at speed 0.004--><div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Château de Seneffe. Passepartout pointed out  the front door and into the entrance hall on the piano nobile. I recalled it was bought by Joseph Depestre. My guidebook claimed it was erected between 1763 and 1768 in a novel neoclassical style. I admired the gilded gate in the middle. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a local headquarters and a summer residence for the German military Governor of Belgium?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I said. Passepartout examined the coats of arms of Joseph Depestre and his wife flanked by gilded lions. It was convenient for the castle and its grounds. We made full benefit of an unhampered view on the broad courtyard (Cour d'honneur) in front of the castle. Things were never the same after the Belgian State decided to purchase it in 1970. We met Laurent-Benoît, an old friend of mine who was in the area. <!--visiting 50.525970387892/4.2692415519398 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 50.599489007183/4.323708135246 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Nivelles-Baulers. My guidebook claimed it was supposed to alternate between Walloon and Flemish circuits. It was clearly flat and featureless. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't considered safe enough for Formula One because of the condition of the tarmac. <!--visiting 50.622106095388/4.3270444603843 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Hougoumont. It was clearly once upon a time Dutch speaking. My guidebook said it was later pronounced Honberg. Passepartout remarked that it didn't mention any building on the grounds. Passepartout remembered it becoming the property of the Intercommunale (1815). I found and admired a large number of troops. <!--visiting 50.85/4.35 at speed 0.001--><div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near La Monnaie. It looked as if it was extensively renovated in the 1980s. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was built between 1695 and 1700 by the Venetian architects Paolo and Pietro Bezzi! Passepartout commented that it didn't have any whitewashing at all. I spent some time perusing large rehearsal halls for opera. Things were different after it burnt to the ground on 21 January 1855 leaving only the outside walls and portico. We ignored the severe politics of the Austrian Emperor Joseph II. <!--visiting 50.85054035397/4.3544639176573 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 50.850247468706/4.3553165961655 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 50.850757551522/4.3570725449192 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 50.857377598693/4.3568235836315 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed the site of Duchess of Richmond's ball.

Passepartout observed that it wasn't part of the principal property that the Duke of Richmond had rented on the Rue des Cendres. At this point, Laurent-Benoît had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at Château de Seneffe. <!--visiting 50.854318619447/4.3597748633244 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 50.854750581917/4.3624244518564 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 50.856885092951/4.3681311594287 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 50.864824227599/4.3726268050911 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 50.874587752336/4.3759681523655 at speed 0.016--><!--visiting 50.889036650289/4.3820608521524 at speed 0.032--><!--visiting 50.93174583078/4.3899408571773 at speed 0.064--><!--visiting 50.932563045686/4.3905171902377 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was running short, so we  retraced our steps to Botanique/Kruidtuin metro station and caught the next train, alighting near Bouchout Castle. If I recalled correctly, this was strategically positioned between the County of Flanders and the Berthout family. I remembered it was built by Wouter van Craaynem at the end of the Grimbergen Wars (1150-1170). Passepartout remarked that it didn't have any direct heirs. We agreed it was written Boekhout in modern script. Passepartout and I enjoyed a detailed copper etching of the Duchy of Brabant. It seemed perfect for meetings. At this point, Tilman-François had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at Laeken Cemetery. We moved on, disappointed by lack of maintenance. <!--visiting 50.928914715281/4.3293798612 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near King Baudouin Stadium. I recalled it was inaugurated on 23 August 1930. It was clearly built to embellish the Heysel plateau in view of the 1935 Brussels International Exposition. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't well maintained. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for athletics and it still hosts the Memorial Van Damme every year." said Passepartout. <!--visiting 50.89652147785/4.3346614978488 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Atomium. I could see that it was closed to the public in October. It looked as if it was sold to the public as souvenirs. We admired the panoramic view of Brussels. It seemed handy for the five habitable spheres which contain exhibit halls and other public spaces. We noted "complications" and referred to a meeting they had with SABAM. <!--visiting 50.895538229763/4.3416888791649 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Mini-Europe. It looked as if it was of €10 million in 1989. It was clearly used for two of the models. I admired the turnover of 4 million Euros. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for two of the models." said Passepartout. I spent a few minutes studying live action models such as trains. <!--visiting 50.894816184573/4.3395777912629 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 50.898299457041/4.3375451962102 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 50.899651537766/4.3300921444634 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to King Baudouin metro station and caught an express train, alighting near Brussels and the European Union. To the best of my knowledge, this was unable to formally back Brussels due to internal instability. Passepartout said it was chosen as a provisional seat. Passepartout observed that it wasn't consulted on the matter of its own location. We agreed it was put into action over a few a long period rather than all at once. Passepartout and I admired the long history of hosting the institutions of the European Union within its European Quarter. I tripped over the Commission's Secretariat-General and Legal Service. We made full benefit of enough space for Parliament with no major new building projects foreseen. Passepartout recounted how it had been annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to house 3000 officials which soon proved too small. Things were different after only a month before talks to enter its application. We moved on, unsure what to make of internal instability. <!--visiting 50.840819678921/4.380573147824 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 50.844416813507/4.3828127804493 at speed 0.002--><p class="new">It was a short walk to European Commission. Passepartout pointed out  an unusually high number of press releases. If I remembered correctly, this was the supranational administrative executive of the new European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). It looked as if it was the new relationship between the executive and the Council. Passepartout commented that it wasn't in force and Barroso was not "elected" by the Parliament. We enjoyed a number of candidates and was thus criticised by some MEPs: following the drawn-out selection. We admired the duty to ensure the treaties and law are upheld. I found and admired a legal Notice and warning about copyrighted material. It seemed handy for documents on EU biofuel policy. We took advantage of that the most recent European elections should be "taken into account" when appointing the Commission. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of EU law. We noted a majority (17&comma;664) of staff being based in the country. <!--visiting 50.844430646646/4.3833508067761 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We approached Berlaymont building. Passepartout told me it was still being discussed. I remembered it was then occupied by the Dames de Berlaymont. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't in a position to buy. We thought it was put in danger if the Berlaymont were to be destroyed. We admired the cruciform design with four wings of unequal size spanning from a central core. Did it convey a feeling of light and transparency? We were not sure. Passepartout was unimpressed by the headquarters of the European Commission. It seemed handy for the ground floor. We took advantage of natural light to the restaurant and multimedia centres. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to house 3000 civil servants and 1600 cars in a four-level underground car park under the whole complex. We traversed the 42 lifts and 12 escalators. Things changed after Berlaymont 2000 took over in 1996 and set up a team to carry out the necessary studies. We encountered a local shopkeeper, who introduced themselves as Marcel. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"This design concept reflects both the 20th century innovative spirit and sheer audacity and brings to mind the astonishing civil engineering arrow at the 1958 exhibition." said Marcel. We moved on, disappointed by the lack of large office blocks. <!--visiting 50.844430646646/4.3833508067761 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 50.845288870424/4.3814563436362 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 50.850483468803/4.3828793976589 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 50.850443174781/4.3815315252408 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 50.862545620853/4.3791847188444 at speed 0.016--><!--visiting 50.888435866096/4.4055755509876 at speed 0.032--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  walked to Maelbeek/Maalbeek metro station and caught a train, alighting near NATO. Passepartout talked about  direct military action. It looked as if it was signed on 4 April 1949. I could see that it was built up under the direction of two US supreme commanders. Passepartout commented that it didn't actually lead to direct military action. We took advantage of a "double framework" for the EU countries that are also linked with the PfP programme. Passepartout mourned it having been appointed to the post. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction. Things were different after the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states. At this point, Marcel reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return home via Berlaymont building. We noted that country's 1966 decision to remove itself from NATO's integrated military structure. <!--visiting 50.876931345454/4.422516466048 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Brussels Cemetery. My guidebook told me it was first suggested in 1861. It was clearly launched by Queen Victoria in the United Kingdom to finance a suitable monumemt.

Passepartout asked me if it was founded in 1982 by Johan David, but I did not know. It looked as if it was recognized as a museum by the Flemish Community. Passepartout and I admired the extensive collection of hand tools. It seemed perfect for milling demonstrations. <!--visiting 50.928316542267/4.3717772856539 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 50.909106852624/4.394160359366 at speed 0.002--><p class="new">Our train arrived near Royal Palace of Laeken.

Passepartout was unimpressed by the grave of Rubens in the eastern chapel. At this point, Emile departed from our company, saying that they had business to attend to back at Antwerp Zoo.

Passepartout pointed out  two years' delay. My guidebook claimed it was used to elaborate a solution to congestion problems in and around Antwerp. It looked as if it was responsible for the realization of this traffic model for the province of Antwerp. Passepartout observed that it wasn't expected to gain great popular support. Passepartout remembered it becoming clear that the survey of alternative proposals had been completed as early as June 8. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was an inner ring road for local traffic?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. Passepartout was unimpressed by a number of unsafe areas. It was convenient for the city of Antwerp as well as to the port. Passepartout disapproved of it being forbidden to make any decisions that might diminish traffic levels in the Oosterweel tunnel. Things changed after the beginning of February 2009 to complete the survey. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should the city of Antwerp support the request for a building licence for the Oosterweel connection according to the proposed layout, between Zwijndrecht/Linkeroever and Merksem/Deurne?" asked Pierre.

It was clearly a small chapel of Our Lady from the 9th to the 12th century. I could see that it was replaced by a larger Romanesque church (80 m long and 42 m wide). We admired the carillon with 49 bells. Did it demolish the building but after each blow? We thought so. I found and admired a number of significant works by the Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens. <!--visiting 51.221364263233/4.4011437768657 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.222728597484/4.4008986835491 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.224534493999/4.4015533058808 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 51.22752643268/4.4091762402764 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 51.241937942479/4.4142133332905 at speed 0.016--><!--visiting 51.266354795299/4.4171554915092 at speed 0.032--><!--visiting 51.331870527773/4.4680057252434 at speed 0.064--><!--visiting 51.332678630429/4.4685947669203 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 51.396887411995/4.4422981587951 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 51.465712098243/4.4534948937308 at speed 0.004--><div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Lost, we  doubled back to Essen (B) railway station and caught the next train, alighting near RBC Stadion.

Passepartout admitted that he wasn't deported because he had "a Norwegian wife"; Martin Mankowitz changed his last name to Meholm.

Passepartout admitted that he didn't feel he could create a beautiful enough image. We admired the small side chapel has a Pietà (1559) by Baccio Bandinelli and graces his tomb.

I admired the single nave with side chapels designed in the late 16th century by Giambologna. I found and admired the major collection of works by Fra Angelico. At this point, Theodor reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return home via Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg. <!--visiting 43.779416688237/11.258781266736 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 43.78014165469/11.259801216271 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 43.78234811081/11.2585233869 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 43.786441082344/11.258460874961 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Stibbert Museum.

As far as I knew, this was set up to raise awareness of media diversity and freedom issues in Europe. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't until over a decade later that the idea began to bear fruit. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the academic publications by the members of the EUI. It was within convenient distance of archival material. We made full benefit of teaching and supervision to PhD students. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to cover the main subject areas of the Department's work.

Passepartout made a joke about  the front door of the Villa. It looked as if it was the country residence of Cosimo I de' Medici. It was clearly located near a Roman aqueduct. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't only a form of political theater; it was also a pleasure garden. I recalled the Castello Plan of the same name. I found and admired some of the great art treasures of Florence. We traversed the two ornamental stairways. We were greeted by a taxi driver, who introduced themselves as Niccolo. We noted the statue of Orpheus, a legendary Thracian musician. The sculptor had captured the brother named Linus who went to Thebes and became a Theban perfectly. It seemed fitting somebody who was buried in Pieria should have such a statue in Villa di Castello. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"At this place the Duke began to build a little, one thing after another, to the end that he might reside there more commodiously, himself and his court." said Niccolo. <!--visiting 43.820417864593/11.228423848346 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 43.807634145118/11.248190115173 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 43.813296152353/11.250474294533 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 43.826055414821/11.236438057263 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 43.807533697151/11.233833423235 at speed 0.016--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Villa di Quarto.

Imagine my surprise to learn it was completed on 26 May 1992 and the southern end of the Bologna-Florence Direttissima! I remembered it was constructed between 1932 and 1934. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to replace the aging Maria Antonia Station. <!--visiting 43.777082544032/11.248292869759 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled to Basilica of Santa Maria Novella. To the best of my knowledge, this was built on the site of the 9th-century oratory of Santa Maria delle Vigne. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was assigned to Dominican Order in 1221. I admired the particular historical significance. I found and admired a smaller Chapel of the Most Holy Sacrament. Passepartout whispered it was thought to have been originally made for the chapel's altar. <!--visiting 43.775571474147/11.249537145485 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We approached Holy Trinity (Masaccio). Unless I was mistaken, this was one of his last major commissions. If I remembered correctly, this was Vasari's deliberate intention to preserve Masaccio's painting. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't recovered until the mid-20th century. It was hard to believe it was ever an altar. Did it match and/or complement the painted architecture? We were not sure. Passepartout recounted how it had been transferred to canvas. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Masaccio's Trinity: Altarpiece or Tomb?" asked Niccolo. We ignored the lack of documentation about the exact circumstances of the piece's creation. <!--visiting 43.775415912837/11.249403820852 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Tornabuoni Chapel. If I recalled correctly, this was created by Domenico Ghirlandaio and his workshop between 1485 and 1490. Unless I was mistaken, this was first frescoed in the mid-14th century by Andrea Orcagna. Passepartout observed that it didn't lose the commission however. Passepartout and I admired the total of seven narrative scenes which are read beginning from the bottom. Passepartout was unimpressed by a preparatory sketch for the women on the left. We ignored his alleged sterility. <!--visiting 43.776099253583/11.249662147798 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to Medici Chapel. I remembered it was designed by Michelangelo. It looked as if it was not begun until the early 17th century. Passepartout took notes on the taste of its time. Was it four Medici tombs? We thought not. We made full benefit of the equivalent of an apsidal chapel. <!--visiting 43.776116021028/11.253808927215 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by was Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici. My guidebook told me it was the last scion of the House of Medici. If I remembered correctly, this was the only daughter of Cosimo III de' Medici. Passepartout commented that it didn't like the idea of a French marriage. Passepartout and I enjoyed no offspring.

Passepartout asked me if it was transferred to its present building, but I did not know. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was destroyed in the 1966 floods.

I admired the small museum of Renaissance art with works by Luca della Robbia. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a small museum of Renaissance art with works by Luca della Robbia. We were approached by a dishevelled character, who introduced themselves as Filippo. We admired the statue of Ferdinand I of Tuscany, Grand Duke of Tuscany from 1587 to 1609. The sculptor had captured the large reception at the Medici Villa in Poggio a Caiano perfectly.

Passepartout asked me if it was one of the oldest and most favoured of the Medici family estates, but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was owned by Averardo de' Medici! Passepartout observed that it didn't quite meet these demands. Passepartout remembered it becoming his favourite residence. It seemed quite suitable for hunting. We made full benefit of another possible reason for the conservative design of the castle - Cosimo had been heavily criticised in Florence by the Florentine nobility for what was considered the pretentious design of the more Renaissance Palazzo Medici-Riccardi. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was vacated in 1587 for the Palazzo Pitti. The mood here changed after all the Medici holdings were once more reassembled in the hands of Cosimo I de' Medici.

Passepartout remembered it becoming known as the Apollo temple after an Apollo statue by Josef Nepomuk Muxel was added to it in 1791. Passepartout and I enjoyed by the water pumping mechanism. We admired the diameter of 19 m. It functioned well as pasture for sheep. I spent a while studying as many people as one would find in a medium-sized town.

Unless I was mistaken, this was replaced by the Reichsrat (1919-1934). Passepartout commented that it didn't have voting rights. We agreed it was elected at the same date as the Bundestag. I admired the suspensive veto (Einspruch). We took advantage of the Bundesrat with an absolute veto of such legislation.

I could see that it was born in Oranienburg near Berlin and was later President Jimmy Carter's Secretary of the Treasury. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"That which can never be exhibited when it comes to Jewish Berlin history: Humanity reduced to ashes." said Albert. <!--visiting 52.501177207868/13.395568342422 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 52.496133413523/13.392249555822 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 52.488099952941/13.398387706806 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 52.487870403826/13.3931698432 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Viktoriapark. It was clearly inaugurated at the top of the 66 m promontory west of the road to Tempelhof. I recalled it was annulled by the groundbreaking 1882 "Kreuzberg judgement" of the Prussian Royal administrative court. Passepartout remembered it becoming the name giver of the Kreuzberg borough created by the 1920 Greater Berlin Act. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was air-raid shelters?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I said. We helped ourselves to an excellent viewpoint over much of the central and southern portions of the city. We traversed the paths. <!--visiting 52.488067110679/13.381126539055 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Schwerbelastungskörper. Albert told me it was one component of a plan to redesign the center of Berlin as an imposing. It looked as if it was estimated as equivalent to the load calculated for one pillar of the intended arch. I spent some time examining rooms which once housed instruments to measure ground subsidence caused by the weight of the cylinder. <!--visiting 52.483208271427/13.372239862503 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Platz der Luftbrücke (Berlin U-Bahn). My guidebook claimed it was designed by Alfred Grenander. It looked as if it was therefore constructed with an unusually high vault and long platform.

It looked as if it was intended to provide direct access to Tempelhof Airport. It was clearly the world's first direct airport-underground railway connection. Albert remembered it becoming known as Line 6 and in 1986 as U6. It was convenient for Tempelhof Airport. <!--visiting 52.47723505334/13.386682746965 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Alt-Tempelhof (Berlin U-Bahn). Unless I was mistaken, this was already planned before World War II. Imagine my surprise to learn it was begun in the late 1930s! Passepartout observed that it wasn't resumed and construction of the stations did not begin until 1961.

Passepartout asked me if it was not much of a view and it accordingly attracted few visitors, but I did not know. I could see that it was also a wooden construction and had a shingled facing. It functioned well as a radio transmission tower as well as an observation post for artillery units. <!--visiting 52.416382658634/13.625545037963 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Berlin-Müggelberge TV Tower.

I admired the radar dome on its top. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was radio relay link station?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I said. <!--visiting 52.415828528502/13.6369322764 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Berlin-Friedrichshagen station.

It was clearly the fiefdom of the knight family von Britzke. It looked as if it was forced to sell the estate to the Prussian crown in 1699. We thought it was the core of the building. Passepartout took a photograph of the three hundred continuous history of the Schloss Britz. I spent a while studying a bronze copy of a neo-classical sculpture made by Pavel Sokolov which he created originally in 1816 for the park of the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo. Passepartout said it was thought to have been planted at the beginning of the 19th century.

It was clearly the brainchild of the Viennese theatrical impresario Emanuel Schikaneder. Passepartout asked me if it was only in 1798 that he felt ready to act on this authorization, but I did not know. We enjoyed with the Vienna State Opera. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't imagine a worse place for several years." said Passepartout. He disapproved of it being converted to a parking garage. Things were different after finally he was forced to sell the theatre at auction in 1826. We were approached by a taxi driver, who introduced themselves as Caspar. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ludwig van Beethoven lived in the in 1803 and 1804." said Caspar. <!--visiting 48.200155140769/16.363762521818 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Academy of Fine Arts Vienna.

It was clearly refounded as the k&period;k&period; Hofakademie der Maler. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for academic purposes." said Passepartout.

Unless I was mistaken, this was originally called the Vienna Court Opera (Wiener Hofoper). My guidebook claimed it was renamed the Vienna State Opera. Passepartout observed that it wasn't deliverable. Caspar and I enjoyed each day of a week. Caspar and I admired the opera school for boys and girls between the ages of eight and fourteen. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a cheaper alternative to the Kaiserstein?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the children's productions!" said Passepartout. Caspar explained how it had been designed to reach out and embrace a new audience was conceived. <!--visiting 48.203766307193/16.368623263003 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Albertina. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was erected on one of the last remaining sections of the fortifications of Vienna. Passepartout said it was refurbished by the director of the Hofbauamt. At this point, Caspar entered a nearby museum and bade us farewell. <!--visiting 48.205432954659/16.36792890501 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Josefsplatz. Passepartout told me it was commissioned by Emperor Francis II who. It was clearly designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and his son Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach. Passepartout was unimpressed by the art collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm between 1614 and 1662. We noted the statue of Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor from 161 to 180. Passepartout thought the statue should have been wearing an oath to protect the emperors. The sculptor had captured the markedly different personality from Marcus: he enjoyed sports of all kinds perfectly. To think that somebody who was grateful that should have such a statue in Josefsplatz. <!--visiting 48.207431503959/16.367371194982 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Spanish Riding School. Passepartout told me it was first named during the Habsburg Monarchy in 1572. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was first commissioned in 1565. It seemed quite suitable for various ceremonies. Passepartout was unimpressed by the Spanish Riding School and the Redoutensäle. Passepartout disapproved of it being asked to do under saddle. Things changed after they can perform the high school movements. We admired the statue of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, Holy Roman Emperor from 1765 to 1790 and ruler of the Habsburg lands from 1780 to 1790. The sculptor had captured the policy of war perfectly. It seemed fitting somebody who was akin to the Jacobins should have such a statue in Spanish Riding School.

I could see that it was the center of Jewish life and the Viennese Jewish Community in the Middle Ages. If I remembered correctly, this was to become Judenplatz around 1150. We admired the symbolic entrance. We couldn't fail to notice the statue of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, a German writer. <!--visiting 48.212654624446/16.369039976402 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">Moving on, we arrived at Maria am Gestade. It looked as if it was traditionally used by sailors on the Danube river. Passepartout said it was a wooden church at this place in the 9th century. We enjoyed the (later modified) plan for the towers of St&period; Stephen's cathedral. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was an arsenal and stable during Napoleon's occupation of Vienna in 1809?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. I spent a while studying two high gothic panels (1460). Passepartout said it was believed to have been conceived as a family burial ground.

I remembered it was designed by the architects Gustav Peichl. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was completed in 1999 for the coming of the third millennium.

It was clearly established as an autonomous organization on 29 July 1957. I recalled it was held at the Headquarters of the United Nations to approve the founding document for the IAEA. Passepartout observed that it didn't learn from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for military purposes." said Passepartout. We made full benefit of direct assistance to IAEA Member States.

Passepartout talked about  human rights violations. I remembered it was renamed the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in 2002. It looked as if it was established to assist the UN in better addressing a coordinated. Passepartout observed that it didn't promote harm reduction policies like needle exchange and Heroin-assisted treatment. Passepartout and I recalled the International Anti-Corruption Day.

It looked as if it was built between 1973 and 1979 just north of the river Danube. Passepartout asked me if it was constructed over the existing parking deck near the southern perimeter of the campus, but I did not know. We joined some tourists who were admiring the indoor link to the VIC buildings. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for meetings." said Passepartout. <!--visiting 48.235711320595/16.417091681344 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.23670042119/16.417238922689 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 48.23703965644/16.415811695276 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I walked to Donau City.

We enjoyed by natural and man-made events. It seemed a fine spot for purposes other than detecting nuclear explosions. We helped ourselves to unambiguous evidence of a nuclear explosion.

As far as I knew, this was consecrated to the patron saints of the Imperial couple on July 31. Did it serve both as a memorial to the historic event and a gravesite for Freiherr von Sothen and his wife Franziska? We thought not. <!--visiting 48.260432063686/16.310712402135 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Schloß Pötzleinsdorf. Passepartout told me it was a nobleman's residence in the mid-17th century. I recalled it was bought by Countess Philippina von Herberstein toward the end of the 18th century.

Unless I was mistaken, this was opened in 1907 but was ruined and partially destroyed in the Kristallnacht pogrom in November 1938. To the best of my knowledge, this was ruined and partially destroyed in the Kristallnacht pogrom in November 1938. <!--visiting 48.240432690233/16.353486174617 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With some urgency, we ran to Jewish cemetery in Währing. My guidebook claimed it was the main burial site for members of the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien. I recalled it was partially destroyed during the time of the Third Reich. Passepartout observed that it wasn't buried in this family tomb. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for building work at the Urban-Loritz-Platz." said Passepartout. He took notes on the neoclassical architecture. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the graves of historically relevant people such as Fanny von Arnstein and the Epstein family. It seemed handy for the cemetery at € 400 - 800&comma;000. Things changed after then irregular guided tours of the cemetery are now offered on a monthly basis. We encounted some problems with its deteriorating condition. <!--visiting 48.23348823499/16.351264053144 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Rothschild Hospital. As far as I knew, this was the hospital of the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde in Vienna. Imagine my surprise to learn it was demolished in 1960 and replaced by a new building which houses a chamber of commerce! We admired the chamber of commerce. Things were different after its closure by the Nazis in 1943. <!--visiting 48.227100587367/16.349041456966 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.226143088761/16.340862695134 at speed 0.002--><p class="new">Moving on, we arrived at Vienna General Hospital. Unless I was mistaken, this was lacking for the establishment of the buildings. I remembered it was made possible by the will of Ferdinand Baron von Thavonat. We admired the wide view of the old General Hospital in Vienna. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for the treatment of the patients has not been clarified." said Passepartout. Nicolò said it was thought to have been not intended as lightning protection. At this point, Nicolò reluctantly left us, saying that they had business to attend to back at Lauder Business School. We moved on, disappointed by innovations in the therapy for mental patients. <!--visiting 48.220989431242/16.34765294651 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Narrenturm (hospital). Imagine my astonishment to learn it was that Joseph II had learned about similar institutions in France during his travels there! It was clearly a visible expression of the segregation. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't an implementation of Jeremy Bentham's hypothetical panopticon. <!--visiting 48.219599403415/16.35348589515 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.218087728624/16.354471594277 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Votive Church, Vienna. I recalled it was dedicated in 1879 on the silver anniversary of Emperor Franz Joseph and his wife Empress Elisabeth. Imagine my surprise to learn it was in residence at the Hofburg Palace! Things changed after the police guards arrived to take him into custody. We noted the statue of John the Baptist, a Jewish itinerant preacherCross. Passepartout thought the statue should have been wearing a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. Who could forget that famous line, "And we -- what are we to do?". The sculptor had captured the daughter by the name of Salome perfectly. We were impressed that somebody who was a 'righteous and holy man' should have such a statue in Votive Church, Vienna. <!--visiting 48.216266369847/16.358763069213 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to University of Vienna. Passepartout told me it was founded on 12 March 1365 by Rudolf IV. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was German-speaking when founded! Passepartout commented that it didn't ratify the deed of foundation that had been sanctioned by Rudolf IV. We visited more than 6&comma;000 students. It was handy for the public. We took advantage of direct access to information such as electronic journals. We noted pressure exerted by Charles IV. <!--visiting 48.214043950398/16.359874155582 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.21364293924/16.361692715851 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Schottenstift, Vienna. Imagine my surprise to learn it was known in Latin as "Scotia Major"; therefore! Passepartout said it was to be occupied exclusively by these "Iroschotten" ("Solos elegimus Scottos"). Passepartout remarked that it didn't come directly from Ireland. Passepartout remembered it becoming popularly known as the Schubladkastenhaus ("the chest-of-drawers house"). We encountered a fellow tourist, who introduced themselves as Andreas. <!--visiting 48.213210674911/16.364595955311 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">Nearby was Schottenkirche, Vienna. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was a three-aisled Romanesque pillar church with a single apse. Passepartout asked me if it was seized as an opportunity to completely rebuild the church in Baroque style, but I did not know. We moved on, avoiding lack of money. <!--visiting 48.212888458186/16.364851493942 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.213921409598/16.366969310392 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 48.218954063941/16.36727223574 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Flex (club). Passepartout asked me if it was primarily a club to listen to the newly imported music genre, but I did not know. Unless I was mistaken, this was implemented in the first five years or so. We made full benefit of ear plugs free of charge for those who find it necessary to dampen the loud bursts of bass and sound. At this point, Andreas entered a nearby bar and bade us farewell. <!--visiting 48.219044254034/16.370706943675 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.220311430252/16.377801462768 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 48.219788148723/16.38448839719 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 48.22835408828/16.385837832906 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 48.234319166023/16.394587514897 at speed 0.016--><!--visiting 48.27097292147/16.383692931904 at speed 0.032--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  walked to Wien Praterstern railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Nussdorf weir and lock. Unless I was mistaken, this was finally scrapped in 1945. Passepartout commented that it didn't rise by more than 80 centimetres. Passepartout examined a list of Vienna's bridges which uses the name "Schemerlbrücke". The mood here changed after World War I and was finally scrapped in 1945. We were hailed by a dishevelled character, who introduced themselves as Otto. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amtliches Wiener Straßenverzeichnis - 16." said Otto. <!--visiting 48.260155141398/16.369319063783 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Heiligenstadt Parish Church St. Michael.

Passepartout and I enjoyed by the same architects. At this point, Otto entered a nearby museum and bade us farewell. <!--visiting 48.254322286081/16.354597436094 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.256699192944/16.3594721907 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 48.252453591501/16.366407547727 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 48.257073755747/16.366215728171 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 48.272887945554/16.36864706541 at speed 0.016--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to MODUL University Vienna.

Imagine my astonishment to learn it was scavenging for berries with her child when she was surprised by Turkish soldiers! I could see that it was surprised by Turkish soldiers. Passepartout examined the congregation's theological college and a museum. We were hailed by a fellow tourist, who introduced themselves as Hans. We admired the statue of Louis IX of France, a Capetian King of France who reigned from 1226 until his death. The sculptor had captured the great love for the Church perfectly. To think that somebody who was the only canonized king of France should have such a statue in Kaasgrabenkirche. <!--visiting 48.254321995833/16.333210299974 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Hans and I hitched a lift to Döbling Cemetery. Hans told me it was expanded in 1781; records exist of its use until 1783. Passepartout asked me if it was torn down and rebuilt in 1826, but I did not know. Passepartout observed that it didn't want to be buried at the city's main cemetery. I spent a while examining 67 graves dedicated in honour of notable individuals. We took advantage of space for 6853 plots. Hans explained how it had been designed to accommodate not just Oberdöbling's dead. <!--visiting 48.239599019069/16.328210594419 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 48.245586717936/16.321422515339 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 48.250064561234/16.331731378499 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 48.268182707413/16.347896353941 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to travel further on foot, we walked to Wien Heiligenstadt railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Kahlenbergerdorf Parish Church.

My guidebook claimed it was one of the main political centres in the early Polish state. I could see that it was raised to the status of a cathedral in 968 when the first missionary bishop. Things were different after the period of the pagan reaction and the raid of the Bohemian duke Bretislav I (1034-1038). <!--visiting 52.412376018866/16.947937706862 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Church of Saint John of Jerusalem outside the walls. I remembered it was built at the end of the 11th century. Passepartout said it was one of the first brick-built churches in Poland. I admired the asymmetric roof. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was least until 1360?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. <!--visiting 52.410431824921/16.959047228302 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Ostrów Tumski, Poznań.

Unless I was thinking of something else, this was baptised in 966 (see Baptism of Poland). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was the archives and museum of the archdiocese?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I said. Passepartout examined the cathedral and associated ecclesiastic buildings in the central part of the island. Passepartout said it was rumoured to have been first used by Dobrawa. Things were different after his death in 1520 (he was also a lawyer and diplomat). <!--visiting 52.412653818039/16.948770918475 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">We alighted from a coach near Stalag XXI-D.

Unless I was mistaken, this was a province of Prussia from 1848 and as such part of the German Empire from 1871 until 1918. I could see that it was part of the Prussian Partition. Passepartout admitted that he didn't write or talk about it much it pre-occupied his mind vastly. Passepartout mourned it having been banned from schools and government offices as part of the Germanisation policies. We enjoyed the famous support and sympathy for Polish plight under Prussian rule Demonstrations at news of Prussian-German victories manifested Polish independence feelings and calls were also made for Polish recruits to desert from the Prussian Army -- though these went mainly unheeded. We had heard stories of state sponsored colonisation. <!--visiting 52.400986463092/16.916830653438 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This was also the location of Poznań 1956 protests.

Passepartout commented that it didn't bother to use local regulars from Poznań garrisons. Passepartout remembered it becoming the official line of the government for years to come.

Passepartout remembered it becoming the State High School and Middle School. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for the construction of the catholic church of St Peter's and St Paul." said Passepartout. He took notes on the Polish modernism of the interwar period. Was it a temporary monument? We thought not. I found and admired a conference of representatives.

We noted a lack of funds. <!--visiting 55.801054107901/37.477838274297 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Moscow Aviation Institute.

To the best of my recollection, this was cut in 2003 from the nearby Metro Market shopping center. I remembered it was the northwestern terminus of the line until 1964 when 3 northern stations were opened. Passepartout observed that it didn't cause any injuries. We moved on, unsure what to make of workers setting up an advertising billboard in the street above the tunnel. <!--visiting 55.804621512309/37.51617809426 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 55.799268300478/37.534613358134 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  doubled back to CSKA Universal Sports Hall and arranged passage on a boat. Some time later, it docked near CSKA Universal Sports Hall and we walked the rest of the way. Passepartout asked me if it was completed in the year 1979 during the preparations for the 1980 Summer Olympics, but I did not know. I could see that it was used as a venue for the 1980 Olympic basketball tournament there. It was hard to believe it was ever a venue for the 1980 Olympic basketball tournament there. <!--visiting 55.788761521127/37.543516507522 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Khodynka Field. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the site of the first Russian powered flight! Passepartout asked me if it was co-ordinated by Mikhail Lentovsky and included four theatres, but I did not know. Passepartout remarked that it didn't cancel the coronation ball scheduled for later that day. It seemed quite suitable for the ill-fated coronation of Tsar Nicholas II. <!--visiting 55.78679509441/37.5335143461 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 55.786422494826/37.532944260197 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to Megasport Arena. Unless I was mistaken, this was completed in December 2006. Passepartout said it was one of the arenas to host the 2007 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships. I admired the maximum capacity of 13&comma;926 people. We moved on, unsure what to make of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. <!--visiting 55.786233209531/37.541178952582 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 55.788576306835/37.559654482901 at speed 0.002--><p class="new">Passepartout, Nina and I hitched a lift to Young Pioneers Stadium. Imagine my surprise to learn it was used as a venue of the hockey tournament at the 1980 Summer Olympics!

It looked as if it was part of Leningrad Highway (Petersburg Highway prior to 1924). Unless I was very much mistaken, this was established when the road was properly paved between 1786 and 1790. We visited the Dynamo Stadium (1928) and CSKA Moscow winter stadium. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was Moscow's airfield?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I said. I found and admired the national Exhibition of Industry and Arts. We enjoyed the legendary Stalinist architecture Leningradsky Prospekt. The mood here changed after the 1950s; irregular DOSAAF flights continued until the 1980s. <!--visiting 55.792247017752/37.54917958041 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 55.793639953198/37.539970770118 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina drove us to Khodynka Aerodrome.

We visited a large number of stored aircraft from Sukhoi and Mikoyan-Gurevich (which were moved to Lukhovitsy). <!--visiting 55.787882256439/37.534208564977 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 55.790141791463/37.540592404481 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 55.786721250116/37.533105204736 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 55.783494934701/37.540425784551 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Begovaya (Moscow Metro). It looked as if it was opened on 30 December 1972. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was covered in dark coloured granite and the walls with ceramic tiles! Did it use the typical column tri-span "Novaya Sorokonozhka"? We thought not. <!--visiting 55.77347605688/37.547746076559 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 55.767040831965/37.544277845116 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 55.751320773358/37.538443859973 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Federation Tower. I could see that it was conceived by Sergei Tchoban and Peter Schweger. It looked as if it was made by the Discovery Channel TV channel in 2009. Passepartout observed that it didn't clearly comment on the reasons for this decision was also unusual. Passepartout and I admired the trapezoidal shape rather than hexagonal as in the earlier design. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to have 94 above-ground and 3 underground floors. Things changed after it resumed in August 2011 and is now expected to be completed in 2015. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fire was visible from much of the Russian capital's western half." said Nina. We avoided the world economic recession and lack of funding. <!--visiting 55.749771955715/37.538138886836 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Vystavochnaya.

Passepartout asked me if it was the work of architects Aleksandr Vigdorov, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for the ceiling." said Passepartout. It was convenient for Moscow Expocenter. <!--visiting 55.750197361487/37.541799996519 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 55.749123344713/37.541499863751 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder cracked in the distance as we approached City Hall and City Duma. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was cancelled because of the global financial crisis of 2008! Passepartout asked me if it was planned to build a complex of buildings for the executive and legislative branches of the capital, but I did not know. At this point, Nina entered a nearby hotel and bade us farewell. <!--visiting 55.751095217967/37.542110983714 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 55.750539976058/37.541611049284 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 55.747626585641/37.544831326508 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 55.746997628582/37.544937591219 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 55.747328587165/37.552930742439 at speed 0.016--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Kiyevskaya (Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line). Passepartout made a joke about  Kiyevskaya and thence to that station's entrance. I could see that it was the terminus of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line. Passepartout and I recalled the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Russia and Ukraine. <!--visiting 55.744310640895/37.565493860449 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 55.743844722484/37.567484971261 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 55.745011596604/37.568378767175 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 55.748004679268/37.590277114954 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 55.74847958701/37.605764278044 at speed 0.016--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to CSKA Sports Complex and arranged passage on the next boat. Some time later, it docked near Pushkin Museum and we walked the rest of the way. It was clearly founded by professor Ivan Tsvetaev (father of the poet Marina Tsvetaeva). Imagine my surprise to learn it was finally renamed to honour the memory of Pushkin in 1937! We joined some tourists who were admiring the numismatic collection which is unpublished. We encountered a local, who introduced themselves as Roman. <!--visiting 55.747448918734/37.60597396493 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">Passing Independent University of Moscow, we approached Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. I could see that it was destroyed in 1931 on the order of the Soviet Leader. I remembered it was supposed to make way for a colossal Palace of the Soviets to house the country's legislature. Passepartout commented that it wasn't laid until 1839. <!--visiting 55.744888421723/37.606451595842 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Palace of the Soviets. It was clearly a project to construct an administrative center and a congress hall in Moscow. It looked as if it was won by Boris Iofan's neoclassical concept. We enjoyed another iteration of the original concept. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for Moscow's defense fortifications and railroad bridges." said Passepartout. Did it carry the main hall columns? We were not sure. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arc lamps will flood the villages, towns, parks and squares, calling everyone to honor Lenin even at night." said Roman. <!--visiting 55.745156035619/37.60673433167 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing a main road, we approached Kropotkinskaya. I recalled it was designed by Alexey Dushkin and Ya. It was clearly originally planned to serve the enormous Palace of the Soviets (Dvorets Sovetov). Passepartout observed that it didn't come from the demolished Cathedral. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to be the largest and grandest station on the first line. <!--visiting 55.745635873811/37.604641906993 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 55.746396774614/37.608534434576 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 55.74906667/37.61542222 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Grand Kremlin Palace. Roman pointed out  the Palace of Facets. It looked as if it was built from 1837 to 1849 in Moscow. To the best of my knowledge, this was intended to emphasise the greatness of Russian autocracy. Roman and I admired the total area of about 25&comma;000 square metres. It seemed perfect for this purpose. Did it emphasise the greatness of Russian autocracy? We were not sure. <!--visiting 55.75/37.61666667 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Palace of Facets. Unless I was mistaken, this was at the coronation of Nicholas II in 1896. It was clearly rebuilt in 1994 at great expense. Roman and I admired the area of about 500 m² (5&comma;380 ft²). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for holding formal state receptions." said Passepartout. I spent a while perusing what used to be the main banquet reception hall of the Muscovite Tsars. <!--visiting 55.750217347306/37.617664842274 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing a main road, we approached Ivan the Great Bell Tower. Roman talked about  the highest observation deck. Passepartout asked me if it was built in 1508 for the Russian Orthodox cathedrals in Cathedral Square, but I did not know. It was clearly erected by Grand Duke Ivan Kalita. I admired the four-story rectangular base with large arched recesses for the bell choir stalls. It functioned well as bell choir stalls to supplement the hanging bells. I found and admired the Great Assumption Bell which was cast in the mid-19th century by Zavyalov. We moved on, unsure what to make of the walls being five meters thick. <!--visiting 55.750772894564/37.619053732108 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">We strolled a short distance to Moscow Kremlin. I remembered it was continuously inhabited by Finno-Ugric peoples since the 2nd century BC. Unless I was mistaken, this was unearthed by Soviet archaeologists in the area. Passepartout observed that it wasn't satisfied with the Grand. We enjoyed a bombastic Neoclassical design on a heroic scale. We joined some tourists who were admiring the suite of rooms in the Kremlin. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for coronation ceremonies." said Passepartout. I spent a while studying dazzling reception halls. Things changed after the Khrushchev Thaw that the Kremlin was reopened to foreign visitors. Our visit was cut short due to lack of funds. <!--visiting 55.751606231434/37.618775951919 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Dormition Cathedral, Moscow. Imagine my amazement to learn it was a medieval burial ground! Unless I was very much mistaken, this was replaced by a limestone structure built around 1326. Passepartout remarked that it didn't use cantilever vaults as was common in Russian architecture. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a horse stable?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. <!--visiting 55.75105067363/37.617942612052 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Tsar Cannon. I remembered it was cast in 1586 in Moscow. Passepartout said it was never intended to be transported on or fired from this gun carriage. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't used during the French invasion of Russia. We enjoyed in 1834 as a decoration. We admired the length of 5. Was it transported on or fired from this gun carriage?

It looked as if it was a Soviet governmental institution - a permanent body of the Supreme Soviets (parliaments). Passepartout said it was of the all-Union level (Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union). Passepartout remarked that it wasn't in session. <!--visiting 55.752239558498/37.620998171741 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Saint Basil's Cathedral. As far as I knew, this was the city's tallest building until the completion of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower in 1600. Imagine my surprise to learn it was erected in 1588 over the grave of venerated local saint Vasily (Basil)! Passepartout remarked that it didn't need to house substantial congregations. Passepartout and I silently remembered the capture of Kazan and Astrakhan. Roman remembered it becoming a public museum. We joined some tourists who were admiring the floor area of only 64 square meters. It seemed quite suitable for a new belltower. Things were different after the completion of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower in 1600. At this point, Roman had to leave, saying that they had to return home via Pushkin Museum. <!--visiting 55.752439556945/37.624053731647 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">With no time to lose, we walked to Kremlin Wall Necropolis. As far as I knew, this was designated a protected landmark in 1974. I remembered it was a boggy moat spanned with stone bridges. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't yet tested properly. Passepartout remembered it becoming the first of twelve individual graves of top-ranking Soviet leaders (see Individual tombs section). I could hardly hear Passepartout over the noise of the picks and shovels. We took advantage of a backdrop for the present-day Necropolis. Passepartout mourned it having been buried at the Novodevichy cemetery at the request of his family. Things changed after the funeral of Pyotr Voykov in June 1927. <!--visiting 55.75355066294/37.620720391405 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to spare, we ran to Red Square. To the best of my knowledge, this was applied to a small area between St&period; Basil's Cathedral. Passepartout asked me if it was meant to serve as Moscow's main marketplace, but I did not know. Passepartout commented that it wasn't until 1661-62. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a state Pharmacy's garden for growing medicinal plants?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I said. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the embalmed body of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. We noted their inextricable links to Russian history since the 13th century. <!--visiting 55.75410622089/37.62099817128 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Lenin's Mausoleum. Unless I was mistaken, this was charged with building a structure suitable for viewing of the body by mourners. Imagine my surprise to learn it was determined that it would be possible to preserve the body for much longer than usual; therefore! Passepartout remembered it becoming acceptable to remove the escalator. We admired the escalator once used by members of the politburo to ascend the tribune. I found and admired an escalator once used by members of the politburo to ascend the tribune.

Passepartout observed that it didn't have shortages of consumer goods. I admired the clear roof. We were approached by a fellow tourist, who introduced themselves as Vladimir. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vladimir G&period; Suchov 1853-1939." said Vladimir. <!--visiting 55.754661768148/37.622387061114 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 55.755740196565/37.625218561639 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Epiphany Monastery, we approached Kitay-gorod.

Vladimir remembered it becoming the official countryside residence of tsar Aleksey Mikhailovich. We joined some tourists who were admiring the territory of 1608. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a hospice and a house for the veterans of the war with Napoleon?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."

Passepartout was unimpressed by the Lubyanka prison and one directorate of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). We couldn't fail to notice the statue of Cheka, the first of a succession of Soviet state security organizations. Passepartout thought the statue should have been wearing black leather.

Passepartout looked up at the statue of Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953.

I could see that it was built in 1855 and lit in 1857. I remembered it was vulnerable to seasonal flooding. Passepartout observed that it wasn't visible at sea and was only usable as an aid to ships approaching the river. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was automated in 1966. We moved on, disappointed by the Light House Board's insistence that ships be able to plot a course based on visible lighthouses. <!--visiting 43.662283809416/-124.19747602585 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 43.712324371148/-124.1003338535 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 43.73024856827/-124.10600010828 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was running short, so we  made our way to Reedsport Community Charter School and arranged passage on a fishing boat.

Alfred and I enjoyed dangerous high-pressure steam. We admired the long history of ROTC Cadets. It functioned well as classrooms and the Boise High School library until the 1990s tech building was constructed. Passepartout was unimpressed by the humanities classes whereas this new building houses science. It seemed handy for physical activity. Things were different after the 1990s tech building was constructed. At this point, Alfred had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at Boise, Idaho.

I could see that it was renamed Cardinal Stritch College in honor of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee's Samuel Cardinal Stritch. I remembered it was subsequently accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1953. Passepartout recalled the time before it was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1953. <!--visiting 43.139993508096/-87.909000021073 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 43.110987172424/-87.925000041137 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Sprecher Brewery. It was clearly founded in 1985 in Milwaukee by Randal Sprecher. It looked as if it was employed by Pabst in Milwaukee. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a primary ingredient in its root beer and Sprecher Ginger Ale uses real?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. We enjoyed the legendary Black Bavarian (Schwarzbier)and premium sodas. We met Charlie, an old friend of mine who was passing by. <!--visiting 43.099703616035/-87.918566020378 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was WXSS.

If I remembered correctly, this was completed in August 1962 and was briefly the tallest free-standing tower in the world. Passepartout asked me if it was briefly the tallest free-standing tower in the world, but I did not know. Things were different after a move to WVTV's tower in 1981 (eventually moving to the new digital-ready MPTV Tower in 1999). We ignored WOC-TV of Davenport. <!--visiting 43.090549200259/-87.896222240223 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">Thunder cracked in the distance as we approached WMIL-FM. Imagine my surprise to learn it was voted "Top Country Station in a Large Market"! We took advantage of news and weather content to iHeartMedia's Milwaukee stations. We noted an anomalous quirk between the lower VHF TV and FM bands. <!--visiting 43.095993625933/-87.903000020315 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 43.096987246013/-87.903000040666 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 43.095974503732/-87.900000081258 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Charlie and I walked to WKTI. I could see that it was a pioneer of FM broadcasting. It looked as if it was renamed WTMJ-FM and it moved to the 88-108 MHz band. Passepartout remarked that it didn't make changes in response to the competition. Passepartout examined the WKTI call sign at its adult standards station in Powell. Things were never the same after Journal's sale of the station to local interests in December 2012. We moved on, avoiding WTMJ's coverage of a sudden flash flood situation. <!--visiting 43.090993239271/-87.90100045023 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 43.090987277836/-87.895000040464 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 43.090974555673/-87.893000080928 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked a short distance to Benjamin Church House (Shorewood, Wisconsin). Passepartout asked me if it was built during 1843-1844 by a pioneer carpenter of that name in Kilbourntown, but I did not know. I remembered it was constructed in Greek Revival style architecture with four front columns and symmetry of floor plan. We moved on, unsure what to make of a city renumbering project. <!--visiting 43.092132525998/-87.89733335025 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Shorewood High School (Wisconsin). Unless I was very much mistaken, this was renovated and now houses the Community Fitness Center. I could see that it was the first high school in its area to perform the musical "A Chorus Line" in 1986. Passepartout examined the Community Fitness Center. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Publish Date Unavailable." said Charlie. <!--visiting 43.088132536535/-87.887833350183 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Klotsche Center. To the best of my knowledge, this was named after UWM's first Chancellor. We visited the Milwaukee Panthers men's and women's basketball teams and the women's volleyball team. Passepartout disapproved of it being moving its men's basketball games from U&period;S&period; Cellular Arena back to the Klotsche Center for the 2012-2013 season. <!--visiting 43.079407669648/-87.878783020037 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. It was clearly founded with the belief that Milwaukee needed a great public university to become a great city. We visited the only graduate school of freshwater science in the U&period;S&period;. We joined some tourists who were admiring the total student enrollment of 27&comma;813 and 1&comma;623 faculty members. Did it prevent overflows and backups into neighboring homes? We were not sure. I found and admired the Departments of Sociology. It seemed handy for public bus transportation in Milwaukee. We took advantage of students learning spaces to study and work together. Charlie explained how it had been designed to expand UWM's research enterprise through investment in projects with anticipated return on investment through extramural funding. We traversed the Ernest Spaights Plaza. Things changed after Marquette disbanded its program in 2011. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arnold's Drive-In." said Charlie. <!--visiting 43.075023681471/-87.881915019962 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Riverside University High School. Imagine my surprise to learn it was at a Jefferson St&period; location in its founding year of 1868! My guidebook claimed it was known at the time as Folsom Place. Passepartout remarked that it didn't have a school cafeteria and lacked a full library. It seemed quite suitable for rehearsal purposes as well as final dress rehearsals. It was certainly handy for the auditorium and two stairwells to access either basement level gym. Charlie explained how it had been designed to bear the weight of the building. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Word on the River." said Charlie. <!--visiting 43.070549253621/-87.888722239885 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 43.070904055024/-87.885472259785 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 43.07684570645/-87.876344079971 at speed 0.004--><p class="new">We caught a cab to Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee. To the best of my recollection, this was constituted November 28. It was clearly elevated to Archdiocese on February 12. We admired the membership of 591&comma;890 Catholics in 204 parishes. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archdiocese of Milwaukee is launching a national advertising campaign to notify sex abuse victims of their deadline to file claims." said Charlie. <!--visiting 43.06860484835/-87.867888869856 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Thomas A. Greene Memorial Museum. I could see that it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993. It looked as if it was given to Greene by the scientist Increase A&period; Lapham. It functioned well as academic space for UWM's Sam and Helen Stahl Center for Jewish Studies. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a wide range of minerals and ores from localities throughout North America. <!--visiting 43.078888111224/-87.877061130027 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Engelmann Field.

Charlie told me it was originally the home of Milwaukee native Charles Allis and his wife. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was the first president of the Allis-Chalmers Corporation! Passepartout examined a collection of paintings. At this point, Charlie departed from our company, saying that they had business to attend to back at Sprecher Brewery. <!--visiting 43.053604848827/-87.889277799601 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 43.050543054314/-87.890500039098 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 43.047886126608/-87.891097298022 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Cleopatra's Wedge.

Passepartout asked me if it was built in 1920 by developer Oscar Brachman for hotel tycoon Walter Schroeder, but I did not know. It looked as if it was originally U-shaped in plan. We moved on, disappointed by suffocation in his apartment on the fifth floor. <!--visiting 43.045827089855/-87.89927779947 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Cathedral Church of All Saints (Milwaukee).

Unless I was mistaken, this was a French Canadian born in a small village near Montreal. Passepartout said it was a French trader with the American Fur Company. We admired the statue of Solomon Juneau, a fur trader. It seemed fitting somebody who was selling plots of land in Juneautown should have such a statue in Juneau Monument. <!--visiting 43.042798487845/-87.89726834942 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Milwaukee Art Museum. It looked as if it was still a growing port town with little or no facilities to hold major art exhibitions. Unless I was mistaken, this was created by a group of German panorama artists and local businessmen. I spent a while studying a movable. We were approached by a local, who introduced themselves as David. <!--visiting 43.039285777456/-87.89625401936 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Discovery World.

I spent a while perusing interactive exhibits. It seemed handy for pro-level software and screen printing equipment. We made full benefit of an array of maritime experiences. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to teach visitors how to understand water as a resource.

Passepartout asked me if it was made in 1857 and is still in use today, but I did not know. It looked as if it was later filled to provide railroad access. We visited the Port of Milwaukee. It seemed quite suitable for a system of docking terminals. Passepartout was unimpressed by a couple of mature trees. <!--visiting 43.01789239471/-87.897597739006 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">Some distance further was Rockwell Automation Headquarters and Allen-Bradley Clock Tower.

Passepartout told me it was designed by architect Frederick Velguth in the German Gothic Revival style and built in 1901. It was clearly almost complete for the December 1. Passepartout observed that it wasn't finished and the trumpets froze in the cold church.

It looked as if it was extensively redesigned in the summer of 2008. Imagine my surprise to learn it was closed during the summer of 2008 to facilitate the replacement of 800 cracked glass panels! We visited a number of colorful birds. We enjoyed a double red-colored cone. Passepartout examined a large number of plants native to the Sonoran Desert. We bumped into a dishevelled character, who introduced themselves as Donald. <!--visiting 43.026425812495/-87.944963019143 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Menomonee Valley.

We noted its photogenic design. I found and admired the company's vast collection of historic motorcycles and corporate archives. It was within convenient distance of Lake Michigan and other waterways. At this point, Donald entered a nearby museum and bade us farewell.

We visited stadiums for the track and field. Passepartout remembered it becoming affiliated with a local medical school. Passepartout and I enjoyed theater and performs in a traditional theater setting. We admired the student body of about 12&comma;000. Did it motivate and enable low-income and first generation students? We thought not. I found and admired the university's College of Communication. We took advantage of members with an opportunity to develop and share musical talents through participation in a large-group setting.

My guidebook told me it was built in 1896 for George Brumder to house the headquarters of his burgeoning publishing empire. It looked as if it was designed by German-trained architects Schnetzky & Liebert and was. We admired the statue of Germania (personification), the personification of the German nation or the Germans as a whole.

Passepartout observed that it didn't require any government licensing. Passepartout and I admired the range of between 6 and 20 miles.

We made full benefit of some contrasts of its own. <!--visiting 42.388578787603/-82.947388900317 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 42.371748516728/-82.96498000022 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 42.361348796915/-82.977672259931 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Manoogian Mansion. Passepartout told me it was built in 1928 for $300&comma;000 but the owner lost the home during the Great Depression. It was clearly the Armenian immigrant's way to thank his adopted hometown. Passepartout observed that it didn't immediately move into the mansion because of city budget issues. We admired the boat house. I spent a short time examining three sunrooms facing south and the river. <!--visiting 42.353717772326/-82.980694449891 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 42.355791093392/-82.984700019832 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Detroit Towers.

Passepartout asked me if it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, but I did not know. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was treasurer and general manager of Detroit Motor Casting. I admired the number of architecturally-significant homes built in the early 20th century. I spent over an hour studying many historic homes including that of automotive entrepreneur Henry Leland. <!--visiting 42.360273314885/-82.995111119969 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">Passepartout suggested that we visit Arthur M.

Passepartout asked me if it was used as both a training facility and civic event site, but I did not know. He said it was used as a barracks and schoolhouse for Navy diesel and electrical schools. We visited Marines and Sailors of Headquarters and Service Company. It was hard to believe it was ever both a training facility and civic event site. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a large array of Depression-era WPA art by artists such as John Tabaczuk. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was renamed the R&period; Thornton Brodhead Armory. <!--visiting 42.348606676338/-82.996500009829 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder cracked in the distance as we approached MacArthur Bridge (Detroit). Unless I was mistaken, this was later renamed the Douglas MacArthur Bridge after General Douglas MacArthur in 1942. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was restored in 1986 at a cost of $11! It was within convenient distance of Belle Isle. We made full benefit of main access to Belle Isle. <!--visiting 42.34249558288/-82.997472229756 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 42.342486749158/-82.995472249264 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix. It was clearly planned to be moved to Belle Isle. Passepartout asked me if it was replaced by a CART event, but I did not know. Passepartout observed that it didn't rule out a return in the future. It seemed handy for the track. We avoided CART remeasuring all circuits in 1997. <!--visiting 42.33610671019/-82.994555569679 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Belle Isle Aquarium. My guidebook told me it was the oldest continually operating public aquarium in North America when it closed on April 3. To the best of my knowledge, this was operated by the Detroit Zoological Society prior to the 2005 closure. We visited over 1&comma;500 fish of 146 species. <!--visiting 42.336603928713/-82.984352789686 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to F. J. Brennan Catholic High School. It was clearly originally named Corpus Christi High School (meaning "the Body of Christ") and was founded in 1953. I could see that it was the first Catholic co-educational secondary school in Windsor. I admired the enrollment of 631 students. <!--visiting 42.32499563004/-82.975000009548 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 42.334791927182/-82.983397359329 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Coventry Gardens.

Passepartout commented that it didn't care to keep living in the big home alone. It functioned well as a banquet hall. <!--visiting 42.318225648875/-83.009440009466 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 42.316102419645/-83.030222238881 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church (Windsor, Ontario). Unless I was mistaken, this was the largest congregation by membership within the Presbyterian Church in Canada (PCC). If I remembered correctly, this was at that time part of the UPC's Presbytery of London. It functioned well as the council chambers by the municipal government until Windsor constructed its first town hall. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to seat 800.

Passepartout examined the following collections on 150 acre: ; Chestnut Collection :Established in 2000 with 5 transplanted. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was recommended to others worried about tree theft. At this point, William reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return home via Andrew Dickson White.

Passepartout asked me if it was closed and has been converted into a student center, but I did not know. Passepartout remembered it becoming the third female residential college at Cornell. I admired the personal sink. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the Carol Tatkon Center in which the residents can borrow movies.

Passepartout remarked that it wasn't a business. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was models by GE?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have here a suburban residential plot second-to-none between New York and Chicago, either in layout, restrictions, or the class of houses upon it." said Edward.

Passepartout and I enjoyed a variety of iron-based products. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was "flux" to help in the fusion of the ores?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly."

Unless I was mistaken, this was founded in 1953 as the Hudson Valley Technical Institute. Passepartout said it was to provide practical hands-on vocational training for veterans returning from World War II. We admired the enrollment of nearly 13&comma;000 students. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for the college's Pharmacy Technician training program." said Passepartout. I found and admired the college's training classrooms in semiconductor manufacturing technology. It seemed handy for over 30&comma;000 journal titles through a range of print and electronic journals. We helped ourselves to over 100&comma;000 volumes in print.

I spent a while perusing 30 buildings. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Ever Widening Circle: The Diffusion of Feminist Values from the Troy Female Seminary, 1822-1872." said Edward.

Passepartout was unimpressed by the administrative offices of the institute. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"To develop technically sophisticated business leaders who are prepared to guide their organizations in the integration of technology for new products, new businesses, and new systems." said Edward. <!--visiting 42.729994391428/-73.680800015728 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Passepartout talked about  bachelor's. Imagine my surprise to learn it was around $40 per semester (equivalent to $800 in 2012)! Unless I was mistaken, this was a small but vibrant center for technological research. Passepartout remarked that it didn't sit well with many faculty; on April 26. We visited the RPI Engineers men's and women's ice hockey teams. We admired the competitive Division I hockey team who won NCAA national titles in 1954 and 1985. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for storage." said Passepartout. He took a photograph of the French Second Empire architecture. I found and admired the Institute at the time was destroyed in this fire. We took advantage of several programs that extend to not only freshman. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to match colors with the church. Things were never the same after the completion of the Folsom Library in 1976. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change at Rensselaer in the last five years has occurred with a scope and swiftness that may be without precedent in the recent history of American higher education." said Edward. <!--visiting 42.729994391361/-73.676500015729 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">We sprinted to Chapel + Cultural Center at Rensselaer.

Edward pointed out  a decline. Edward told me it was the largest arena in the Capital Region. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was previously an airplane or dirigible hangar for the United States armed forces during World War II! Passepartout observed that it wasn't satisfactory for the creation of an arena. Things were different after tickets went on sale in mid-September. We moved on, disappointed by large support columns that held up the Field House's roof. <!--visiting 42.732050385397/-73.668553015762 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies. I could see that it was chosen to lead the project. If I remembered correctly, this was a national leader in the design of research and biotechnology buildings. Passepartout observed that it didn't begin to use the new facilities until well into the fall 2004 semester. We joined some tourists who were admiring the capacity of 10&comma;350 adult fish. It seemed perfect for almost any type of research activities. I spent some time studying office space for 400 researchers and over 71&comma;500 square feet (6&comma;600 m²) of laboratory space. Edward explained to us how it had been designed to match the red brick construction of the Quadrangle residence hall. Things were never the same after well into the fall 2004 semester. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Form and Flexibility." said Edward. <!--visiting 42.728212396099/-73.677340015702 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Folsom Library. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was only a single room or small part of a room. Passepartout said it was created in line with the Constitution and Laws of the Rensselaer School. Passepartout observed that it wasn't sufficient for the 140000 sqft requirement decided by student and faculty surveying. Passepartout examined an article by Andrews in which he suggested the following changes:Andrews. Edward explained how it had been designed to complement the light gray brick of the nearby St&period; Joseph's Chapel. Passepartout disapproved of it being built. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Troy's One Hundred Years 1789-1889 Troy Irish Genealogy Society." said Edward. <!--visiting 42.729292393385/-73.681513015717 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing a main road, we approached Carnegie Building. My guidebook claimed it was made to remain in Troy but move uphill. Passepartout asked me if it was completed in September 1906 at a cost of $133&comma;000, but I did not know. We visited the Cogworks laboratory. I admired the small drawing room and several classrooms.

Edward told me it was dedicated on 7 October 1977. My guidebook said it was a co-founder of Texas Instruments. We visited the School of Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy. It functioned well as a staging area. I spent a short time examining many major research facilities and a large number of academic classrooms. We took advantage of undergraduate students from multiple engineering disciplines. <!--visiting 42.729716611959/-73.679277795725 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">Passepartout suggested that we visit Greene Building, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. To the best of my recollection, this was completed in 1931 at a cost of $400&comma;000. It looked as if it was named in memory of Benjamin Franklin Greene. We visited the Rensselaer School of Architecture at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). Passepartout examined a gallery for students' work. <!--visiting 42.730004391139/-73.68010001573 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing a main road, we approached George M.

Passepartout asked me if it was a full evacuation of the building and shutdown of all campus activities after his body was found, but I did not know. I found and admired an underground high-bay. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to make one feel almost as if they are in outer space; darkness contrasts with the lit exhibits.

Imagine my surprise to learn it was incorporated in 1873 in the state of New York! It looked as if it was founded as the Pantotherian Society or The Pi Eta Scientific Society in 1866. Passepartout observed that it wasn't within the province of the society. Passepartout remembered it becoming evident that additional funds would be necessary. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for approximately four-years between 1920 and 1924." said Passepartout. Did it erect a clubhouse on the property in the near future? We thought not. He recounted how it had been incorporated under the laws of the state of New York in 1873. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! The vast reach and massive symmetry!" said Passepartout.

My guidebook told me it was created upon the centralization (consolidation) of fourteen smaller districts in Brunswick. I remembered it was created upon the centralization (consolidation) of local schools in 1956. Passepartout observed that it didn't adopt "Brittonkill" on the first attempt. Passepartout remembered it becoming mandatory for students aged 8 to 14. We enjoyed a pamphlet entitled Digest of Facts to inform the community of the project. We joined some tourists who were admiring the total staffing of 81.

If I remembered correctly, this was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1988. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was owned by Brunswick Central School District until it was transferred to the Town of Brunswick in 1986. Passepartout observed that it didn't win the contract. We visited the Brunswick Historical Society. We admired the gabled roof and ornamental woodwork at the peaks of each gable. It functioned well as a cloakroom juts out from the front about ; each classroom had its own entrance. Passepartout recalled the time before it was reconfigured to be a two-room. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to be a beautiful addition to the town and become an icon of education.

I could see that it was upgraded again to become WGNX-LP and gained its current channel allocation. Things were never the same after that was designated for WTEN to use for digital transmissions causing WNGN-LP to move to channel 35. <!--visiting 42.785549796007/-73.628166686612 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked not too far from Lansingburgh Academy. I remembered it was eventually sold to the local library system. Passepartout said it was signed by 27 persons. Passepartout observed that it wasn't large enough to serve the growing student body. It functioned well as a high school. Passepartout examined the names of the first sixteen trustees. It was within convenient distance of the building by the school district. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was sold to the local library system. Things changed after the Association dissolved in 1947. We met John, an old friend of mine who was in the area.

It seemed quite suitable for experimental purposes in the field of textile research as a miniature textile mill. Times certainly changed after their defeat by Catholic Central. <!--visiting 42.775272045317/-73.670111126443 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Oakwood Cemetery (Troy, New York). It was clearly the first rural cemetery association created in the state. Passepartout asked me if it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, but I did not know. We visited thousands of individual statues and sculptures as well as 24 private mausolea. Passepartout and I admired the rock-faced stone exterior covered with foliate carvings. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a public park by Lansingburgh and Troy residents?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I said. I found and admired an onyx altar and mosaic floor made of more than twenty colors of marble. We traversed the triple-arched loggia to a chapel and crematorium on the north side. Things were different after at least the early 23rd century. We admired the statue of Crawford W. Long, unknown outside a small circle of colleagues for several years. To think that somebody who was now recognized as the first physician to have administered ether anesthesia for surgery should have such a statue in Oakwood Cemetery (Troy, New York). <!--visiting 42.763883606935/-73.665389486263 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Herman Melville House (Troy, New York). If I remembered correctly, this was a home of author Herman Melville between 1838 and 1847. I could see that it was originally built about 1786 and substantially remodeled in the Late Victorian style about 1872. We admired the 2-story rear wing.

I remembered it was owned by the Sheldrick family since 1897. Imagine my surprise to learn it was kept largely undisturbed by logging or agriculture! I admired the diverse selection of tree species. I spent a while studying more than six natural communities. <!--visiting 42.82527187552/-71.794833347432 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 42.856932454578/-71.815500035913 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Hartshorn Memorial Cannon. Passepartout told me it was killed during the Battle of Williamsburg in Virginia. He asked me if it was the town's--and according to Lyndeborough's official town history, but I did not know. The mood here changed after substantial changes were made to the fort in the late 1890s. At this point, Charles hailed a cab, saying that they had business to attend to back at All Saints Church (Peterborough, New Hampshire). <!--visiting 42.879438063826/-71.782058188339 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 42.831099267417/-71.774388925062 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Hamblet-Putnam-Frye House. Unless I was mistaken, this was probably built in the 1760s. Passepartout said it was laid out c&period; 1760 which was taken out of public use before the end of the 18th century. Passepartout whispered it was thought to have been built in the 1760s.

Unless I was mistaken, this was funded by the federal Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression. Imagine my surprise to learn it was dedicated to the youth and people of Nashua in memory of Holman's parents! Passepartout observed that it didn't return to Holman Stadium until 1983. We visited several minor-league affiliates of Major League Baseball organizations. It functioned well as a storage shed. Things were never the same after its mid-season eviction for nonpayment of rent. <!--visiting 42.7690803574/-71.472194456546 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Nashua Public Library. My guidebook claimed it was called Hunt Memorial Library In 1867. It looked as if it was located on the second floor of the County Records Building. We admired the variety of databases for cardholders to use for personal and academic research. Passepartout examined an extensive reference collection of books relating to the history of Nashua. Things were different after closing its doors for budgetary reasons in July 2006. We ignored a donation from Mary A&period; and Mary E&period; Hunt. <!--visiting 42.763048154044/-71.463447036451 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Hezekiah and I walked to Southern New Hampshire Heath System.

We took advantage of patients with access to specialty surgeons and oncologists for specialized care or second opinions. <!--visiting 42.756383172756/-71.461500016344 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 42.768877385699/-71.464388923088 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 42.763477050889/-71.465250065833 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 42.755509840476/-71.458666800643 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 42.738798195518/-71.439278037049 at speed 0.016--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Bishop Guertin High School. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was founded by the Brothers of the Sacred Heart in 1963! To the best of my knowledge, this was in Division II until 2013 before moving up to Division I. We admired the successful FIRST robotics team with over 25 members. Things were different after it reaches "Day 1" again and the cycle starts over. <!--visiting 42.738049894142/-71.473722236051 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 42.75332191336/-71.493833362585 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Mine Falls Park. If I recalled correctly, this was purchased in 1969 from the Nashua. Passepartout said it was supposedly mined from the island below the falls. It seemed perfect for various commercial purposes while the river itself suffered from severe pollution. It seemed handy for the playing field area that was formerly only accessible by hiking from the path under the highway from the west. We took advantage of a vertical drop of at the mills. <!--visiting 42.750551249644/-71.503165666247 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 42.750266381235/-71.510500032483 at speed 0.002--><p class="new">We still had a long way to go, so we  walked to Nashua Airport and arranged passage on the next boat. Some time later, it docked near Nashua Airport and we walked the rest of the way. If I remembered correctly, this was known here as the Crown Hill Fire. My guidebook claimed it was Nashua's first casualty in World War II. We moved on, avoiding its use for flight training by adjacent Daniel Webster College. <!--visiting 42.781660882827/-71.513722236746 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at 1886 Mine Falls Gatehouse. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was built in 1886 by the Nashua Manufacturing Company to regulate water flow from the mill yard. Passepartout said it was constructed at Mine Falls. Passepartout examined the machinery that reflects the transition from hydro power to electric power. <!--visiting 42.750410099935/-71.503859936246 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center. My guidebook claimed it was responsible for handling 1&comma;721. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was included with the rest of the TCA in Boston's area of responsibility! We admired the total of 30 sectors. Passepartout took notes on the flexibility of Boston and Washington without which delays would climb significantly. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a number of small airports without SIAPs. We took advantage of service to tower en route traffic entering and departing the New York metropolitan area at and below 10&comma;000 feet. We had heard stories of its close proximity to ARSR and ASR-9 radars. <!--visiting 42.735164342346/-71.479560016005 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 42.749710823037/-71.479388922473 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 42.756366021395/-71.464333395372 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 42.765787380255/-71.460889021962 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 42.761297190945/-71.449000262775 at speed 0.016--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Hills Memorial Library.

Passepartout examined a total of 2500 sqft of usable space divided between the main library floor. We moved on, unsure what to make of a need for extensive repairs. <!--visiting 42.764994258025/-71.437055576485 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered Benson's Wild Animal Farm. Passepartout asked me if it was a long-running private zoo and amusement park in Hudson, but I did not know. I remembered it was founded by John Benson in 1924 as an animal-training center. We noted the statue of Mighty Mouse, originally conceived by Paul Terry. We were impressed that somebody who was drawn slightly differently should have such a statue in Benson's Wild Animal Farm. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Benson's isn't going anywhere!" exclaimed Hezekiah. We moved on, avoiding his drinking. <!--visiting 42.766660663026/-71.404555746514 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 42.793599466047/-71.436611143896 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 42.825254138956/-71.441833399863 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 42.808286431058/-71.475333467471 at speed 0.008--><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Boston Consolidated TRACON.

We made full benefit of service to all training flights conducted by Daniel Webster College. At this point, Hezekiah reluctantly left us, saying that they had business to attend to back at Hamblet-Putnam-Frye House. <!--visiting 42.816594114583/-71.492500017319 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout told me about Holden Medical Institute. My guidebook claimed it was an accredited nursing school with campuses in Lowell and Worcester. If I remembered correctly, this was concern about the ability to transfer credits.

I recalled it was constructed in 1972 as a Junior High School. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was ranked No&period;1 nationally in high school cross country. We enjoyed 4 All-Americans and sent numerous athletes to NCAA Division I sports programs. I admired the quizbowl team that participates in the Granite State Challenge television program. We enjoyed the famous 1990-1999 campaign "Team of the 90's" with top runner John Mortimer who was ranked No&period;1 nationally in high school cross country. We ignored their robot design resembling a sailing ship when full deployed. <!--visiting 42.869160635778/-71.376777798206 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Pinkerton Academy.

Unless I was very much mistaken, this was first dubbed Mystery Hill by William Goodwin. I could see that it was the official name of the site until 1982. Passepartout and I enjoyed three C-14 dates. It seemed perfect for storage purposes. I spent some time examining grooves that some say channeled blood closely resembles "lye-leaching stones" found on many old farms that were used to extract lye from wood ashes. <!--visiting 42.843049595957/-71.205944457785 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Camp Tel Noar.

It seemed handy for the land for provisions. <!--visiting 41.099998574658/14.200999998984 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 41.121108104266/14.182555557741 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 41.061594595424/14.193999576705 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 40.976592232265/14.211299996229 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 40.902163843017/14.25208610611 at speed 0.016--><div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Museo di Capodimonte.

I found and admired a collection of 80 sculptures of magnificent quality. Things changed after the rolls of papyri were discovered among the ruins of the Villa of the Papyri. At this point, Nicola entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. Passepartout looked up at the statue of Athena Promachos, a colossal bronze statue of Athena sculpted by Pheidias. Passepartout thought the statue should have been wearing a belted garment and stretched forward her right hand on which a winged object can be seen. It seemed fitting somebody who was transported to Constantinople (capital of the Eastern Roman Empire) should have such a statue in Villa of the Papyri. <!--visiting 40.807799939549/14.345499589939 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.833332441446/14.318666669803 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 40.817499525387/14.344277669702 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun came out as we approached Herculaneum.

To the best of my knowledge, this was thought until then that the town had been evacuated by the inhabitants. Passepartout observed that it wasn't helped by the methods of archaeology used earlier in the town's excavation. Passepartout remembered it becoming a Roman municipium in 89 BC. We agreed it was essentially invisible to the scans. We enjoyed by filling the body imprints in the ash deposit with plaster. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a trading post because of its proximity to the Gulf of Naples?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. Passepartout whispered it was thought to have been used for storage. Things changed after then that the town had been evacuated by the inhabitants.

Things were different after it was renamed in honor of Kleanthis Vikelidis. <!--visiting 40.600069868097/22.970499999908 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.600070724294/22.972499999725 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Toumba Stadium. If I recalled correctly, this was the contribution and of its own group of fans. Passepartout said it was participating in the then HFF Panhellenic Championship. We joined some tourists who were admiring the number of VIP boxes and VIP lounges. Passepartout examined a number of VIP boxes and VIP lounges. Things were different after the installation of seating on all stands in 1998 reduced the capacity to 32&comma;000 (seated). We moved on, disappointed by this it was heavily upgraded. <!--visiting 40.613839265635/22.973422219929 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Kaftanzoglio Stadium. I recalled it was built with money donated by the Kaftanzoglou Foundation. Passepartout said it was one of the highest quality stadiums in the Balkans. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for both athletics at the Mediterranean Games and the European Cup in athletics." said Passepartout. <!--visiting 40.625497551525/22.968002779945 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. It looked as if it was legislated under Law 3341/14-6-25. Passepartout asked me if it was the second Greek university to be founded after the University of Athens, but I did not know. Passepartout and I admired the reading room for students and a reading room for university researchers and teaching personnel. It seemed perfect for water sports such as swimming. Was it the seat of the second Greek university? We were not sure. We made full benefit of support and information about a variety of subjects including: undergraduate and postgraduate studies in Greek or foreign universities. Times certainly changed after the cemetery's tragic destruction during the Nazi occupation. At this point, Russian entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <!--visiting 40.630000314025/22.959055559951 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.62923113414/22.962800169899 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to University of Macedonia.

Passepartout asked me if it was established in 1990 as The Department of International and European Economic Studies, but I did not know. <!--visiting 40.625300331896/22.960999999945 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">Passepartout and I walked to Nick Galis Hall. It was clearly designed by the architects P&period; Gianettos. Passepartout asked me if it was redeveloped and updated in 2004 in preparation for the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, but I did not know. We admired the seating capacity of 5&comma;138 for basketball games. <!--visiting 40.62689754619/22.958219439947 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.626120657696/22.956549999892 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. Passepartout asked me if it was extensively renovated and its permanent exhibits reorganized, but I did not know. It was clearly a Celtic goddess popular in many parts of Europe (8727857633). Passepartout took notes on the modern architectural trends of Greece. Passepartout looked up at the statue of Harpocrates, the god of silence. Passepartout thought the statue should have been wearing either a curly red or curly blonde wig in character. We were surprised that somebody who was born prematurely with lame legs should have such a statue in Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. <!--visiting 40.625100332649/22.954799999945 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.623900674424/22.956999999886 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 40.627201298665/22.958799999789 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 40.624302688621/22.967599999548 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Thessaloniki Olympic Museum.

We enjoyed are divided in long-term exhibitions.

My guidebook told me it was the Prime Minister of Greece. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was made in accordance with the Law 3341/1925! I spent some time examining about 60&comma;000 book titles. It was convenient for research centers.

I could see that it was founded and began its operation in 1930 during the premiership of Alexandros Papanastassiou.

My guidebook claimed it was then converted to a prison (Φυλακές Επταπυργίου). I admired the 300-strong garrison. We took advantage of the Turkish names for the ten towers: Fener Kulesi (Lamp Tower).

Unless I was mistaken, this was the second largest city of the Byzantine Empire. I could see that it was constructed in the early 4th century AD. Passepartout observed that it didn't hold any physical relics of the saint. We enjoyed by the saint's relics. Passepartout said it was thought to have been larger than the local cathedral. <!--visiting 40.638822500559/22.948858329961 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.635700584682/22.947299999915 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 40.632845653471/22.951094439816 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 40.633302411755/22.957099999636 at speed 0.008--><p class="new">A few streets away was Church of Saint Panteleimon (Thessaloniki). Passepartout told me it was given to the church after the end of Ottoman rule in 1912. It was clearly converted into a mosque in 1548 and became known as Ishakiye Camii ("Mosque of Ishak Isaac").

As far as I knew, this was transferred to Merzifon. We admired the presence at the Youth Parliament of Greece. It was hard to believe it was ever military hospital.

Imagine my surprise to learn it was built in 483/4 by Vahan Mamikonian after the cathedral was severely damaged in a Persian invasion! Passepartout remarked that it didn't come into use until the 15th century. I admired the cruciform plan with a central cupola. I spent a while studying two chapels.

Passepartout told us a long story about  the exterior courtyard. Imagine my surprise to learn it was built by Catholicos Ezra I in the year 630! It looked as if it was the name of an abbess who was martyred with other nuns by Tiridates III of Armenia in the year 301.

The fine architecture of the classical period!" said Passepartout. We looked for churches in Armenian that but weren't able to find any. He said it was believed to have been Artimed.

We admired the square tetraconch highly complex central plan rather than the typically seen rectangular plan. I tripped over the remains of the martyred Saint Hripsimé to whom the church was dedicated. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the fine Armenian-style architecture of the classical period!" said Passepartout.

It seemed quite suitable for the seminary. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"On 1 November 1945, the reopening of the Theological Seminary took place." said Catholicos.

Did it prevent demonstration there? We were not sure. It seemed handy for Liberty Square as well as to other major squares in Yerevan. We enjoyed the legendary prominent role in modern history of Armenia. <!--visiting 40.185279964035/44.515999997615 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.183893269701/44.518944435205 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 40.181953230864/44.52066666034 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 40.183628635553/44.526611090803 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 40.183663687819/44.542611052408 at speed 0.016--><!--visiting 40.196032371289/44.582513816724 at speed 0.032--><!--visiting 40.222629798809/44.634278038073 at speed 0.064--><!--visiting 40.222631828969/44.635278036012 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.235837281916/44.695888886096 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 40.234451588127/44.730943962143 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 40.251126408462/44.671055545372 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 40.256141377138/44.692666641372 at speed 0.016--><!--visiting 40.275058024174/44.692555507394 at speed 0.032--><!--visiting 40.252344303491/44.702333213559 at speed 0.064--><!--visiting 40.252346211137/44.70333321174 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.261114852876/44.738111106498 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 40.212786069885/44.78899999141 at speed 0.004--><h2>Chapter 55</h2><p class="new">We parked near Geghard.

We joined some tourists who were admiring the diamond-shaped plate attached to its end; a Greek cross with flared ends is cut through the plate. It seemed quite suitable for the monastery today. Passepartout examined the tombs of the princes Merik and Grigor. It was convenient for the second rock-cut church. We traversed the two relief crosses.

Passepartout commented that it didn't sound good. I admired the Hanyu pinyin spelling similar to the English abbreviation "CUN". Did it train cadres (officials) for ethnic minority areas? We thought so. We took advantage of a level of acceptance that encourages students to promote their ethnic identity.

It was certainly handy for Google's YouTube site due to footage showing Chinese security forces beating Tibetans; access to other Google online services is denied to users on an ad hoc basis.

We traversed the lobby section. <!--visiting 39.9090047398/116.45399998877 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 39.906148403804/116.45486108737 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 39.905435715156/116.46602773466 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 39.905871399416/116.46105546942 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 39.909894762473/116.47157182063 at speed 0.016--><!--visiting 39.908485157938/116.50977741981 at speed 0.032--><!--visiting 39.909409483465/116.61416128045 at speed 0.064--><!--visiting 39.909414225414/116.6151612692 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Beijing International Studies University. It was clearly part of the national initiative to promote tertiary foreign language education. Passepartout asked me if it was under the supervision of Zhou, but I did not know. I found and admired the main teaching facilities and student amenities. It was within convenient distance of metro subway line 6 and 8T. We made full benefit of housing facilities for most of the undergraduate and postgraduate students. Passepartout recalled the time before it was presented and approved at the State Council in March and later in August. We took some time to enjoy the legendary business administration programs and foreign languages programs. <!--visiting 39.909304740959/116.55869998876 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 39.875919871747/116.48406997564 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 39.873520616108/116.45160127101 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 39.859040269696/116.42759989865 at speed 0.008--><h2>Chapter 56</h2><p class="new">We alighted from a coach near Temple of Heaven. I could see that it was constructed from 1406 to 1420 during the reign of the Yongle Emperor. Unless I was mistaken, this was also responsible for the construction of the Forbidden City in Beijing. We joined some tourists who were admiring the taller. I could hardly hear Passepartout over the sound of the prayer will be reflected by the guardrail. <!--visiting 39.882246566526/116.40746942801 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 39.871009924342/116.39499997538 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 39.872460153622/116.37946534093 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived not too far from Niujie Mosque. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was reconstructed as well as enlarged under the Kangxi Emperor (r&period; 1661-1722) of the Qing Dynasty. My guidebook claimed it was within the Xuanwu District before it merged into Xicheng in 2010. We had a fine view of the mosque from here. <!--visiting 39.88444932216/116.35905554808 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Xinhua News Agency. Imagine my surprise to learn it was started in November 1931 as the Red China News Agency and changed to its current name in 1937! It was clearly described as the "eyes and tongue" of the Party. Passepartout observed that it wasn't just a press office. It was convenient for Tibet during the conflict. We helped ourselves to information and analysis which are not generally available to the public. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to facilitate party control. <!--visiting 39.898768688069/116.36623054849 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 39.897413332292/116.3818446469 at speed 0.002--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Great Hall of the People. My guidebook claimed it was opened in September 1959. I remembered it was one of the "Ten Great Constructions" completed for the 10th Anniversary of the PRC. Passepartout observed that it wasn't held at the Great Hall; it was held at Tiananmen Square. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for legislative and ceremonial activities by the PRC and the Communist Party of China." said Passepartout. We met Zhang, an old friend of mine who was passing by. <!--visiting 39.903338101576/116.38849998862 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. It looked as if it was ousted in a party leadership reshuffle and replaced with Jiang Zemin. I remembered it was widely condemned internationally for the use of force against the protesters. Passepartout observed that it didn't resume until Deng Xiaoping's 1992 southern tour. Passepartout remembered it becoming increasingly unclear with whom the government should negotiate. We enjoyed by Trudie Styler. Passepartout took a photograph of the how to deal with popular unrest. I spent a while examining incorrect English spellings of some victims' names. It was convenient for see their families and often put in cells so crowded that not everyone had space to sleep. Passepartout mourned it having been arrested and taken from his home. Passepartout disapproved of it being a tremendous accomplishment. The mood here changed after Deng Xiaoping's 1992 southern tour. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is necessary to take a clear-cut stand against disturbances." said Zhang. <!--visiting 39.903338101694/116.39266665862 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right around the corner was Monument to the People's Heroes.

I spent a while examining about 17&comma;000 pieces of marble and granite from Qingdao. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eternal glory to the people's heroes!" exclaimed Zhang. <!--visiting 39.903060333463/116.39266665861 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Mausoleum of Mao Zedong. As every schoolboy knows, this was embalmed and construction of a mausoleum began shortly after his death. It looked as if it was built soon after Mao's death on September 9. At this point, Zhang had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at Great Hall of the People. <!--visiting 39.901004785249/116.39249998855 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 39.903342873293/116.39199997723 at speed 0.002--><p class="new">Passing National Museum of China, we approached Tiananmen. It looked as if it was the entrance to the Imperial City. Passepartout asked me if it was originally named Chengtianmen, but I did not know. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't released until 17 years later in 2006. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a national symbol?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. We moved on, avoiding his death. <!--visiting 39.907338118094/116.39208274873 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Nanjing Jinling High School. My guidebook claimed it was relocated to Chongqing due to the Second Sino-Japanese War. I remembered it was part of the Nanking Safety Zone. Passepartout and I admired the long tradition of excellence in athletics. It was hard to believe it was ever the official anthem of Jinling High School since the 1930s. We moved on, unsure what to make of the Second Sino-Japanese War. <!--visiting 39.907304748094/116.39199998873 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Imperial Ancestral Temple. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was the most sacred site in imperial Beijing. Passepartout asked me if it was built in 1420 and used to store imperial ancestral tablets, but I did not know. Passepartout was unimpressed by the memorial tablets of meritorious courtiers. <!--visiting 39.909970252834/116.3945394188 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed the site of Forbidden City. Passepartout told me it was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987. It was clearly called the Ziwei Star. Passepartout remarked that it didn't exist in the Yuan dynasty. Passepartout remembered it becoming the de facto residence and office of the Emperor starting from Yongzheng. We joined some tourists who were admiring the unique place in Chinese culture. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for ceremonial purposes." said Passepartout. I found and admired the Palace's own printing house. He explained how it had been designed to be the centre of the ancient. Things were never the same after he was evicted after a coup in 1924. We moved on, avoiding its significant place in the development of Chinese architecture and culture. <!--visiting 39.91472714445/116.39155632893 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 39.912509434875/116.39311108775 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 39.913989786689/116.39474702565 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 39.915926473737/116.39866658172 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 39.911231177357/116.42127482131 at speed 0.016--><!--visiting 39.90984654437/116.46707964116 at speed 0.032--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Beijing Television Cultural Center.

Imagine my surprise to learn it was installed west of the main plant in order to dispose of Lewisite-filled containers! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for dismantling chemical weapons." said Passepartout. <!--visiting 40.297780121579/-112.34233038054 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right around the corner was Deseret Chemical Depot.

Passepartout remarked that it didn't ruin the historic integrity of the house. Passepartout said it was believed to have been a "polygamy pit": a hidden room where polygamist David E&period; Davis might have hidden from U&period;S&period; marshals seeking his arrest. <!--visiting 40.337223162197/-112.43511111044 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.337225046596/-112.43311111133 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 40.337228815414/-112.42911111311 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 40.337236353124/-112.42111111666 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 40.337251428847/-112.40511112376 at speed 0.016--><!--visiting 40.337281581505/-112.37311113797 at speed 0.032--><!--visiting 40.337341891664/-112.30911116638 at speed 0.064--><!--visiting 40.337342833911/-112.30811116683 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.337344718409/-112.30611116771 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 40.337348487424/-112.30211116949 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 40.337356025529/-112.29411117304 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 40.337371102042/-112.27811118015 at speed 0.016--><!--visiting 40.33740125628/-112.24611119435 at speed 0.032--><!--visiting 40.337461553531/-112.18211122276 at speed 0.064--><!--visiting 40.337462495827/-112.1811112232 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.337464380424/-112.17911122409 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 40.337468149636/-112.17511122586 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 40.337475688137/-112.16711122942 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 40.33749076544/-112.15111123652 at speed 0.016--><!--visiting 40.257258826047/-112.07188891094 at speed 0.032--><!--visiting 40.266738374603/-112.01933337017 at speed 0.064--><!--visiting 40.266739494917/-112.0183333708 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.261502266853/-112.08860000128 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 40.263615352388/-112.01711053255 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 40.263624377254/-112.00911053764 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 40.263642427348/-111.99311054782 at speed 0.016--><!--visiting 40.263678528989/-111.96111056818 at speed 0.032--><!--visiting 40.263750738076/-111.89711060892 at speed 0.064--><!--visiting 40.26389514731/-111.76911069038 at speed 0.128--><!--visiting 40.263896275619/-111.76811069101 at speed 0.001--><div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Utah Valley University. I remembered it was founded in the fall of 1941. It looked as if it was known as the Central Utah Vocational School. We visited the Utah Community Credit Union Center. Passepartout remembered it becoming Utah Valley Community College. We admired the independent. We took advantage of students. We traversed the 30 ft concourses. We met Paul, an old friend of mine who was in the area. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starting in the fall of 2012, UVU will implement a new 'structured enrollment' policy." said Paul. <!--visiting 40.277778873515/-111.7128888906 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.276876191538/-111.7152340012 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 40.27872836397/-111.71295600238 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 40.282708647461/-111.70980000467 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Lakeridge Junior High School. Passepartout asked me if it was nominated for the "National Blue Ribbon" award, but I did not know. As far as I knew, this was won by a landslide due to the efforts of the school as a whole. We had heard stories of the efforts of the school as a whole. <!--visiting 40.279723308511/-111.70400000059 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at George and Temperance Adams House. It was clearly built in 1895 and was expanded in 1903. Unless I was mistaken, this was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Passepartout took a photograph of the economic prosperity enabling better building methods. We looked for agricultural outbuildings but struggled to find any. <!--visiting 40.290278842124/-111.69844444056 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Orem, Utah. Paul told me it was 84&comma;324 at the 2000 census. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was 88&comma;328 making it the fifth-largest city in Utah. We visited three high schools. We admired the total area of 18. We moved on, disappointed by a high population of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. <!--visiting 40.298754040759/-111.69548600054 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.292224334271/-111.68216667112 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 40.28444874697/-111.68266667232 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 40.275008803203/-111.67116667484 at speed 0.008--><!--visiting 40.280850704429/-111.63150000943 at speed 0.016--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near LaVell Edwards Stadium. It looked as if it was just under 30&comma;000 with stands on both sides of the playing field. Passepartout asked me if it was soon added to make room for 35&comma;000 fans, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't imagine a worse place for college football." said Passepartout. We avoided some renovations that allowed for more wheelchair accessibility. <!--visiting 40.257501144477/-111.65344444065 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Marriott Center. As far as I could remember, this was named in honor of benefactor and hotel tycoon J&period; Willard Marriott. My guidebook claimed it was also the largest venue in the nation built for basketball. We visited the BYU Cougars men's and women's basketball teams. It seemed perfect for weekly devotionals and forums. <!--visiting 40.254167823042/-111.64844444066 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With some urgency, we walked to Brigham Young University. My guidebook claimed it was located in the northeast corner of 200 East and 200 North. Unless I was mistaken, this was not absorbed and sponsored officially by the LDS Church until July 18. Passepartout observed that it didn't become a university until the end of Benjamin Cluff. We visited several of the university's departments and programs and is the tallest building in Provo. Passepartout and I enjoyed 10 Rhodes Scholars. We admired the planetarium. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a basketball arena?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a total of 462 apartments in 24 buildings. We helped ourselves to educational programming. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was replaced by Howard S&period; McDonald. Things were never the same after April 1876 when Brigham Young's choice for principal arrived--a German immigrant named Karl Maeser. At this point, Paul had to leave, saying that they had to return home via Utah Valley University. We avoided the fact that 45 percent of the student body at BYU have been missionaries for LDS Church. <!--visiting 40.250001163351/-111.64900000068 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">With no time to lose, we walked to Brigham Young University Museum of Art. I spent some time studying works of art from many renowned artists including Carl Bloch. We took advantage of opportunities for students across the college and the university's campus. We noted a lack of space. <!--visiting 40.250834491345/-111.64705556067 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered to J. Reuben Clark Law School. Passepartout asked me if it was former U&period;S&period; Solicitor General Rex E&period; Lee, but I did not know. I recalled it was the first dean of the school. Passepartout and I admired the collection of over 450&comma;000 volumes and volume equivalents in paper and microform. Passepartout was unimpressed by a collection of over 450&comma;000 volumes and volume equivalents in paper and microform.

My guidebook claimed it was the first head of the engineering department. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't imagine a worse place for research by the College and the BYU campus community." said Passepartout. <!--visiting 40.250001163351/-111.64900000068 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Harold B. Lee Library. Passepartout made a joke about  the location of libraries in other buildings on campus during the 1950s. I recalled it was destroyed by a fire in 1884. It was clearly provided on the second floor of the new building. Passepartout observed that it wasn't dedicated until October 10. We enjoyed by Johannes Gutenberg in about 1450. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for storage as well as a warehouse in downtown Provo." said Passepartout. I found and admired the life science library on the first floor and the music library on the third floor. It seemed handy for several electronic books and scholarly databases from on- and off-campus. He mourned it having been dedicated on October 15. Things were different after it filled the third floor and much of the second floor of the Education building. We were greeted by a taxi driver, who introduced themselves as Lorenzo. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of all the wonderful buildings that we have on the BYU campus, none, I believe, is as important as the library." said Lorenzo. <!--visiting 40.249167835617/-111.64816667068 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Franklin S. Harris Fine Arts Center. Passepartout asked me if it was the first dean of the College of Fine Arts at BYU, but I did not know. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was designed by Harvey Fletcher. I admired the seating capacity of 1269. It functioned well as a site for dances. <!--visiting 40.250001163357/-111.64705603068 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Lorenzo and I walked to Campus of Brigham Young University. Passepartout told me it was built in 1976 to display the many fossils found by BYU's Dr&period; James A&period; Jensen. I recalled it was named for Philip N&period; Margetts. We visited several of the university's departments and programs and is the tallest building in Provo. Passepartout and I admired the extension campus. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a basketball arena?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. Passepartout examined a total of 898 apartments in 72 buildings.

As far as I knew, this was separated from the city by swampland and the city dump. It looked as if it was renamed the Utah State Mental Hospital. Passepartout observed that it wasn't uncommon to see mattresses lining the hallways. Lorenzo and I enjoyed therapeutic results unachievable elsewhere which should be taken into account. It seemed perfect for the spook alley. It was convenient for the public. We took advantage of 324 beds for Utah's mentally ill persons who require treatment in a more structured setting and are assessed to be unable to receive adequate treatment at regional centers. We moved on, avoiding limited knowledge about treatment of mental health at the time. <!--visiting 40.234167873384/-111.63344444072 at speed 0.001--><p class="new">Passepartout told me about Maeser Elementary. Imagine my amazement to learn it was an elementary school in Provo! My guidebook claimed it was named after Karl G&period; Maeser. Passepartout commented that it didn't arrive in Utah until 1860. Times certainly changed after the decision was made to close its doors in 2001. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some of our outstanding men." said Lorenzo. We noted their decision to serve various missions for the church. <!--visiting 40.231112320884/-111.64816667073 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Reed O. Smoot House. It looked as if it was the home of Reed Smoot from 1892 to his death in 1941. I remembered it was a prominent US Senator best known for advocacy of protectionism and the Hawley-Smoot Tariff. I spent over an hour examining modern equipment (National Park Service p&period; 1). It was convenient for the parlor with its original furniture. At this point, Lorenzo reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return home via Harold B. Lee Library. <!--visiting 40.232778986844/-111.65344444073 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I walked to Harvey H. Cluff House. Unless I was mistaken, this was originally owned by Harvey H&period; Cluff. It was clearly built in 1877 by John Watkins of Midway. We visited a man by the name of W&period; Ray Ashworth. We avoided the experience he had gained at the factory. <!--visiting 40.236112308289/-111.65483333072 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing a main road, we approached Knight-Mangum House. Imagine my surprise to learn it was built in the old English Tudor style! I could see that it was built for Mr&period; W&period; Lester Mangum and his wife Jennie Knight Mangum. Passepartout commented that it wasn't NRHP-listed due to owner objection. We admired the asymmetrical composition. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really an apartment building?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. We had heard stories of the fact that they had sold their shares in Jesse Knight's mine located in Tintic. <!--visiting 40.233890094088/-111.65011111072 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Dr. Samuel H.

Unless I was mistaken, this was elected the youngest member of the Utah House of Representatives. Passepartout observed that it wasn't long before Thurman sold the home to John W&period; Taylor. <!--visiting 40.236667867034/-111.65427778072 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing a main road, we approached George M.

I spent a short time perusing nearly all the elements of typical pioneer homes of the mid-1870s (Roberts p&period; 2). <!--visiting 40.235001201065/-111.65177778072 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled to Hannah Maria Libby Smith House. My guidebook claimed it was the wife of George Albert Smith. It looked as if it was designated to the Provo City Historic Landmarks Register on March 21.

Imagine my amazement to learn it was decided that the city of Provo would host the venue! Passepartout said it was planned to be constructed near Provo's East Bay Golf Course. We visited the Peaks Figure Skating Club. It seemed perfect for indoor soccer games. Things were different after Salt Lake City bid again for the 2002 Winter Olympics before any venue planning would start. <!--visiting 40.234723421864/-111.63705556072 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Superintendent's Residence at the Utah State Hospital.

It looked as if it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the earliest organized Christian group in Adair County! It seemed quite suitable for services.

It looked as if it was known as Northeast Missouri State University. My guidebook said it was founded in 1867 by Joseph Baldwin as the North Missouri Normal School and Commercial College. Passepartout remarked that it didn't fulfill the liberal arts mission. We visited the School of Business. Passepartout and I admired the few administrative offices. It was hard to believe it was ever sorority housing. Passepartout was unimpressed by a few administrative offices. We took advantage of help to students in determining a career path. We traversed the breezeways. <!--visiting 40.189171382811/-92.581390000956 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.177802825879/-92.576000001996 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 40.175005681176/-92.585166674034 at speed 0.004--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Kirksville High School. I could see that it was no separate high school building until 1894. My guidebook claimed it was not built until 1899. We enjoyed several individual state champions in varying weight classes from the 1970s through 2012. We made full benefit of students with clubs and organizations in which to participate. <!--visiting 40.185001393701/-92.565000000971 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at A.T.

Imagine my surprise to learn it was the first osteopathic medical school in the world! We admired the average annual enrollment of more than 3&comma;100 students from 35 countries. We took advantage of special care dentistry for low-income patients. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to encourage students' health and wellness. <!--visiting 40.193612370935/-92.57844400094 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to KIRX. I recalled it was filed with the Federal Communications Commission by North Missouri Broadcasting Company. Passepartout asked me if it was ready to begin broadcasting at noon on October 17, but I did not know. I admired the Effective Radiated Power of 250 watts. Things were never the same after the late 1990s when the current format of News/Talk with '50s and '60s oldies was initiated. <!--visiting 40.20666800661/-92.574277780893 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 40.195574951814/-92.579883331866 at speed 0.002--><p class="new">We caught a cab to Trinity Episcopal Church (Kirksville, Missouri).

Passepartout commented that it didn't mean that discovery and science did not continue at the university's observatory. We visited a key innovation in the area of astronomical photometry. Passepartout remembered it becoming standard technique. We enjoyed a series of papers in the Astrophysical Journal on eclipsing binaries Lambda Tauri. We admired the opening of 44 in and can be opened or closed by hand in seconds. It functioned well as a teaching tool in the university's astronomy classes. It was convenient for the clock room through a small window. Things were different after a new director was hired in 1903.

Passepartout remarked that it wasn't pleased about the changes necessitated by the budget shortfall. We agreed it was the home for the School of Music. I admired the camera atop it which captures live video of the Main Quad. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a large lecture hall?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied.

My guidebook claimed it was recognized as a "public elite" school by Newsweek because of its students' high scores on the SAT. Passepartout observed that it wasn't until May 1916 that the go-ahead was going to begin construction on the new design. Passepartout and I enjoyed by the subfreshmen and turn it into an hour-long documentary. We admired the Food Pantry club that volunteers at and raises money for the Wesley Food Pantry. It was handy for the University's library system is equivalent to that of any undergraduate. We took advantage of a number of other benefits to the school's students.

Passepartout took notes on the Progressive Era civic involvement. <!--visiting 41.399998099247/-75.650388001806 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 41.399994298282/-75.648388005418 at speed 0.002--><!--visiting 41.399986696311/-75.644388012642 at speed 0.004--><!--visiting 41.413040066198/-75.638666685004 at speed 0.008--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Jefferson Center Dunmore. Imagine my surprise to learn it was formerly used as a Dunmore School District Elementary School! Were there five or six classes? Passepartout didn't seem to care. It was hard to believe it was ever a Dunmore School District Elementary School. <!--visiting 41.416048054889/-75.628900001892 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Holy Cross High School (Pennsylvania). Imagine my surprise to learn it was renamed Bishop O'Hara High School to commemorate the first bishop of Scranton! I recalled it was built in Scranton to serve Catholic students at the secondary level in the central city. We enjoyed many actors and singers. We admired the academic curriculum that includes four years of Latin. We enjoyed the famous theater department and produced many actors and singers. We noted changing demographics and culture. <!--visiting 41.421248040472/-75.62191667192 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed the site of Scranton State School for the Deaf. I recalled it was a residential school for the deaf established in 1880 in Scranton. My guidebook claimed it was turned over from state management to the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was renamed the Scranton State School for the Deaf in 1976. <!--visiting 41.429698017337/-75.639100001965 at speed 0.001--><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered to Scranton School for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Children. Unless I was mistaken, this was closed at the end of the 2008-2009 school year. As far as I knew, this was renovated in July of 2010. Things were different after the 2010/2011 school year while all residential services moved to the South Abington Township campus. <!--visiting 41.4294680179/-75.640963001964 at speed 0.001--><!--visiting 41.434196010032/-75.66020000398 at speed 0.002-->
