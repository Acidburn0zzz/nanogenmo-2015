<h2>Chapter 1</h2><p class="new">Setting out from Reform Club, we headed for 11 Downing Street. Passepartout asked me if it was Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice in 1806, but I did not know. It looked as if it was appointed as Chancellor by Prime Minister David Cameron on 11 May 2010. Passepartout remarked that it didn't become the Chancellor's official residence until 1828. We admired the larger living area. It functioned well as the Prime Minister's press office. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by was Downing Street. I could see that it was built in the 1680s by Sir George Downing (1632-1689). My guidebook claimed it was built in the 1680s by Sir George Downing. Passepartout observed that it didn't become "10" until 1787. We admired the official residence at Number 12. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a metonym for the Government of the United Kingdom?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I said. I found and admired the Prime Minister's Press Office. It seemed handy for St&period; James's Park. We encounted some problems with an increase in violence. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Foreign and Commonwealth Office. It looked as if it was created in 1968 by merging the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Office. To the best of my knowledge, this was formed in March 1782 by combining the Southern and Northern Departments of the Secretary of State. Passepartout remembered it becoming the responsibility of the separate Department for International Development. It functioned well as offices and storage since the Second World War. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a Government timeline to show the departments responsible for Foreign Affairs from 1945. It seemed handy for resources. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to HM Treasury. Passepartout asked me if it was called the Lord Treasurer, but I did not know. He said it was responsible for appointing George Downing. Passepartout examined a detailed analysis of departmental spending under thousands of category headings. It was handy for finance. We were approached by a local shopkeeper, who introduced themselves as John. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Parliament Square. I could see that it was removed in 1940 and placed in its present position in nearby Victoria Tower Gardens in 1957. I remembered it was redesigned by George Grey Wornum. We visited eleven statues of British. I spent a while studying ten statues of statesmen and other notable individuals. We took advantage of for a different regime of "prohibited activities". Passepartout spoke of the time when it was erected in Manchester. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was House of Lords. It was clearly once an entitlement of all hereditary peers. Unless I was mistaken, this was restricted to 92 hereditary peers. Passepartout remarked that it didn't assemble again until the Convention Parliament met in 1660 and the monarchy was restored. We admired the defined 650-seat membership. We made full benefit of that whenever a vacancy arises among the Lords Spiritual during the ten years following the Act coming into force. Things changed after the establishment of the Supreme Court in 2009. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Commons of England find by too long experience that the House of Lords is useless and dangerous to the people of England." said John. We noted the perceived constitutional anomalies inherent in the role. <p class="new">Nearby was Palace of Westminster. John talked about  the Royal Gallery. It looked as if it was destroyed by fire in 1834. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was built on the site in the eleventh century. Passepartout commented that it didn't have a chamber of its own. Passepartout and I swapped stories about members and staff of both Houses who died in the Second World War. John remembered it becoming clear that some of the stonework had to be replaced. It was hard to believe it was ever a symbol of the strength of democracy. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the Court of Requests; the expansion of the Peerage by King George III during the 18th century. It was handy for the Chamber. John said it was thought to have been originally supported by pillars. Times certainly changed after a fire destroyed much of the complex in 1512. At this point, John had to leave, saying that they had to return to HM Treasury. We encounted some problems with pollution and the poor quality of some of the stone used. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearby was Parliament of the United Kingdom. Passepartout asked me if it was created in 1801 by the merger of the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland under the Acts of Union, but I did not know. To the best of my knowledge, this was superior to the House of Commons both in theory and in practice. We visited the Northern Ireland Assembly. Passepartout remembered it becoming an independent supreme court in 2009. We joined some tourists who were admiring the fixed term of 5 years. It seemed perfect for important legislation. We noted land erosion. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right around the corner was Burning of Parliament. I remembered it was largely destroyed by fire on 16 October 1834. It looked as if it was won by Charles Barry. Passepartout commented that it didn't call for assistance. Passepartout and I enjoyed no visible effect. Were there nine or ten casualties? Passepartout thought nine. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was the home of the British parliament?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. We looked for other parts of the old Houses of Parliament but could not find any. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to burn coal--which gives off a high heat with little flame--and not wood. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to spare, we ran to MI5. Passepartout told me it was put before parliament on the 4th of November 2015. Passepartout mourned it having been placed on a statutory basis in 1989 with the introduction of the Security Service Act. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to give the Germans a false impression of the location and timings of the landings (see Operation Fortitude). Things changed after the early part of the Second World War. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Tate. It looked as if it was designed by Wolff Olins in 2000. Passepartout said it was established by the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 as The Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery. Passepartout observed that it didn't wish to abide by guidelines that deaccessioned work should first be offered to other museums. Passepartout and I enjoyed exclusively by Tate and items represented in its collection. I admired the range of logos that move in and out of focus. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was the operating name for the corporate body?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you ask, I am not so sure." I replied. I found and admired the United Kingdom's national collection of British art. It was convenient for its archives which he then used to forge documents authenticating fake modern paintings that he then sold. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"This new development will transform Tate Modern." said James. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Millbank Tower. Passepartout asked me if it was constructed in 1963 for Vickers and was originally known as Vickers Tower, but I did not know. He said it was originally known as Vickers Tower. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for press conferences." said Passepartout. <p class="new">We strolled to Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. Imagine my surprise to learn it was added to its name in 1988! It looked as if it was the statutory regulatory and professional body for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in England. We took advantage of members with the post-nominals 'MRPharmS' and those members who have been awarded fellowships with 'FRPharmS'. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With some urgency, we ran to Lambeth Palace. My guidebook told me it was a larger area with a notable orchard until the early 19th century. To the best of my knowledge, this was low and sodden: it was called Lambeth Marsh. We joined some tourists who were admiring the tower of 1377 repaired in 1834 and the rest was rebuilt in 1851 using architect P C Hardwick. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a vast collection of material relating to ecclesiastical history. At this point, James entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to The Queen's Walk (South Bank). As far as I knew, this was not established until the completion of construction of London Bridge City c&period;1990 In 1996. My guidebook said it was recognised as a foundation for establishing the Thames Path national trail through London. Things changed after the completion of construction of London Bridge City c&period;1990 In 1996. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Garden Museum. Passepartout told me it was largely a Victorian reconstruction. As far as I knew, this was deconsecrated in 1972 and was scheduled to be demolished. We joined some tourists who were admiring the altar tomb outside. I found and admired the 15th and 16th century tombs of many members of the Howard family. The mood here changed after the churchyard was closed in 1854. We met Philip, an old colleague of mine who was in the area. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to Lambeth Walk. Imagine my amazement to learn it was at the heart of a working class residential area and there was a street market! Passepartout asked me if it was originally developed with wells and a recreation ground, but I did not know. I recalled the popular song of the same name. Passepartout and I silently remembered Charlie Chaplin whose early years were spent nearby. Passepartout recounted how it had been rebuilt. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to A23 road. Passepartout said it was originally proposed to run as far north as Streatham. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for various other London to Brighton events." said Passepartout. He recounted how it had been completed in 2007. We admired the legendary superstores. We moved on, avoiding a lack of funds. <p class="new">Thunder cracked in the distance as we approached St George's Cathedral, Southwark. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was caused by incendiary bombing Opened in 1848. I remembered it was designed by Augustus Pugin. It seemed quite suitable for the Convocations of the Academy of Saint Cecilia. We noted copyright material being used. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at London South Bank University. If I remembered correctly, this was founded in 1892 as the Borough Polytechnic Institute. Passepartout asked me if it was chosen to be clerk to the Governing Body, but I did not know. Passepartout examined the training and demonstrating Centre for Efficient and Renewable Energy in Buildings (CEREB). Passepartout explained how it had been designed to include two Thames barges set above a pentagon surrounded by five other pentagons. We moved on, disappointed by stricter student visa requirements in the United Kingdom. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I walked to Metro Central Heights. Passepartout told me it was originally known as Alexander Fleming House. It was clearly not known at the time of construction. Passepartout was unimpressed by some 400 studio to three-bedroom flats which are in constant demand. We met Ernő, a college friend of mine who was passing by. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered to Elephant & Castle tube station. Imagine my surprise to learn it was approved on 25 July 1890! Passepartout asked me if it was given of a private bill that would be presented to Parliament for the construction of the BS&WR, but I did not know. It seemed handy for the Bakerloo line. We took advantage of the most direct access to the Bakerloo line. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Metropolitan Tabernacle. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was the largest non-conformist church of its day in 1861! My guidebook claimed it was William Rider; other notable pastors and preachers include Benjamin Keach. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a film location in 1991 which portrayed the building as a London night club?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you ask, I am not so sure." I replied. I found and admired a below-floor baptism pool. We took advantage of free video and audio downloads. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Ernő and I walked to John Smith House (Southwark). I remembered it was renamed after John Smith. Passepartout said it was formerly used by Southwark Local Education Authority. At this point, Ernő noticed the time and said they had to leave, saying that they had to return home via Metro Central Heights. <p class="new">We hailed a cab to Burgess Park. I could see that it was carved out of a highly built-up area of the city. I remembered it was the closure of the Grand Surrey Canal in the early 1970s. I found and admired some former roads which have been stopped up but not yet grassed over. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to reflect the diversity of the surrounding population of this highly cosmopolitan portion of London. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was St Peter's Church, Walworth. Unless I was mistaken, this was built between 1823-25 and was the first church designed by Sir John Soane. If I remembered correctly, this was the first church designed by Sir John Soane. We visited many facilities available to the local community. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Kennington Park. As every schoolboy knows, this was opened in 1854 on the site of what had been Kennington Common. Passepartout said it was a site of public executions until 1800 as well as being an area for public speaking. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for major cricket matches in 1724." said Passepartout. We took advantage of a local forum for this struggle. We entered into conversation with a local, who introduced themselves as Charles. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Oval tube station. If I remembered correctly, this was both the first standard gauge tube and the first railway to employ electric traction in London. Passepartout said it was shield-driven at deep level. I found and admired some of the lift equipment; the main part of the building was of red brick. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to The Oval. Passepartout asked me if it was the first ground in England to host international Test cricket in September 1880, but I did not know. Unless I was mistaken, this was the home of the FA Cup final between 1874 and 1892. We visited the first ever international football match on 5 March 1870. We joined some tourists who were admiring the conference and events business. Was it used for enemy parachutists? We were not sure. It seemed handy for the ground and opening up views of the historic pavilion. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was granted. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the bowler runs in, it's so quiet you can hear the creak of the gasometer." said Charles. <p class="new">I remembered St Agnes Place. Unless I was mistaken, this was a squatted street in Kennington. Passepartout asked me if it was the first to be squatted, but I did not know. We agreed it was social/affordable housing. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for housing." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of Kennington Common. I could see that it was a large area of common land mainly within the London Borough of Lambeth. It was clearly notable for being one of the earliest venues for cricket within London. It functioned well as a market garden. Things were different after the end of the 18th century while fairs. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Kennington tube station. Passepartout told me it was opened on 18 December 1890 as part of London's first deep-level tube. My guidebook claimed it was originally similar to the current arrangement at Borough. It seemed a fine spot for posters. It was convenient for the lift. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Royal Surrey Gardens. Passepartout told me it was the site of Surrey Zoological Gardens and Surrey Music Hall. I could see that it was acquired in 1831 by impresario Edward Cross to be the location of his new Surrey Zoological Gardens. It seemed perfect for large public entertainments from 1837. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to King's College Hospital. It was clearly composed of overcrowded slums characterised by poverty and disease. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was treating 1&comma;290 inpatients in 120 beds! Passepartout and I enjoyed at 13 other centres throughout the country. We admired the very large backlog of patients waiting more than 18 weeks for treatment. It seemed quite suitable for military purposes. I found and admired a medical library as well as hosting conferences. We were approached by a taxi driver, who introduced themselves as William. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, William and I walked to Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience. Passepartout asked me if it was also rated 100% 'world-leading', but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was ranked second in the world in Psychiatry and Psychology! We admired the number of specialist services for children and adolescents. Passepartout examined the Medical Research Council Centre for Neurodegeneration Research. It was within convenient distance of two MRI scanners for neuroimaging research. We took advantage of offices. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Maudsley Hospital. I could see that it was one of the originating institutions in producing the Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines. If I remembered correctly, this was used to treat war veterans. Passepartout took a photograph of the value of teamwork: 'psychiatrists to diagnose and to prescribe. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apart from observation and simple treatment, nurses are trained in special investigations and therapy." said William. <p class="new">Passepartout suggested that we visit St Giles' Church, Camberwell. Passepartout asked me if it was almost certainly built of wood and stood amongst fields and woodland, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was later rebuilt in stone by William FitzRobert. William and I enjoyed 53 designs and was won by the firm of Scott and Moffat. We admired the clerestory and lower aisles with five bays and gabled entrance porches. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was the Lady Chapel and the north transept holds the organ?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. I spent a while examining notable stained-glass windows. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Camberwell College of Arts. As far as I knew, this was appointed head of the school's Painting Department. I recalled it was Head of Painting in the early 1960s. William remembered it becoming an independent charity. We admired the purpose built community art and exhibition space. It seemed handy for cultural and educational activity in Peckham. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Queens Road Peckham railway station and caught the next train, alighting near West Norwood Cemetery. I could see that it was also known as the South Metropolitan Cemetery. Imagine my surprise to learn it was founded by its own Act of Parliament of 1836 and consecrated for its first burials in 1837! I found and admired a high density of neoclassical architecture. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was interred there himself. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to West Norwood railway station. Unless I was mistaken, this was renamed on 1 January 1886 by the London. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was due to an influx of new residents who objected to the "lower" suffix being applied! We encounted some problems with an influx of new residents who objected to the "lower" suffix being applied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to South Circular Road, London. Passepartout asked me if it was originally a proposed new build route across South London in the 1920s, but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was under construction by 1921! I admired the adverse effect on the traffic flow. Things changed after the roundabout junction with Rochester Way. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I do not think that the South Circular Road could be said to exist at all." said William. We avoided compulsory purchasing of properties. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Dulwich College. Imagine my amazement to learn it was founded in 1619 by Edward Alleyn! My guidebook claimed it was used colloquially from that date. Passepartout commented that it didn't last long in this form. Passepartout remembered it becoming the home of the Master of the College. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was part of the film set for the Tomb Raider film?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. Did it form the nucleus of the collection of the last king of Poland? We were not sure. Things changed after it was moved to its new (and current) premises in East Dulwich in 1887. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Short tunic buttoned to the chin, trousers of an Oxford mixture, an ordinary rifle cap with a broad band and narrow peak, and a dark coloured Inverness cape for winter." said William. We ignored their particular impact on college life. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather improved as we approached Dulwich Picture Gallery. Passepartout told me it was opened to the public in 1817. Imagine my surprise to learn it was made an independent charitable trust in 1994! We enjoyed the famous innovative Education programme. We moved on, disappointed by a problem with the gallery's heating system. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Crystal Palace transmitting station. Passepartout asked me if it was constructed in the mid-1950s among the ruins of the Crystal Palace, but I did not know. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was destroyed in 1941 during the demolition of the Palace's north water tower. Passepartout observed that it didn't transmit analogue Channel 5: this (alone) came from Croydon. We enjoyed of the construction by BICC at the time which was available on loan from the BICC Film Library. We joined some tourists who were admiring the total height of 708 ft. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for FM radio transmission of local radio stations BBC London 94." said Passepartout. We made full benefit of high power ITV and BBC services for the whole of their region. Things changed after the construction of One Canada Square at Canary Wharf in 1991. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Crystal Palace Park. I remembered it was in turn named after The Crystal Palace which had been moved from Hyde Park. If I remembered correctly, this was forced to relocate during the First World War. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for cultural and sporting events." said Passepartout. He examined the National Sports Centre which includes an athletic stadium. It was handy for the park became possible when the Crystal Palace railway station opened in 1854. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to represent the British Empire. Things were never the same after the club was forced to relocate during the First World War. We noted fire damage. <p class="new">Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Crystal Palace National Sports Centre. It looked as if it was opened in 1964 in Crystal Palace Park. As far as I knew, this was used here between 1895 and 1914. We admired the folded teak lining. It seemed handy for the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre that is also located in the park. Things changed after they moved to the brand new Copper Box in 2013. We moved on, unsure what to make of their failure to obtain the Olympic Stadium. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky darkened as we approached Crystal Palace railway station. I could see that it was moved from Hyde Park to Sydenham Hill after 1851. Passepartout said it was the terminus of a spur line from Sydenham. We agreed it was powered by gravity. It seemed handy for all platforms of the station. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to imitate the central section of the Crystal Palace. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Penge West railway station. It looked as if it was opened by the London and Croydon Railway in 1839. Passepartout said it was only around 270 at this time. It was within convenient distance of these buildings and sidings which served a coal yard and timber yard on the site of the old brickfield. Things were different after April 2005 when it was damaged in a fire set by arsonists. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered to Anerley railway station. My guidebook told me it was in turn replaced by two shelters on the Up platform. It looked as if it was opened originally as Annerley by the London and Croydon Railway in 1839. Times certainly changed after the Privatisation of British Railways. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Croydon transmitting station. I could see that it was established in 1955 and initially used a small lattice tower. It looked as if it was originally used to broadcast the London ITV signal on VHF Band III. Passepartout observed that it wasn't used for regular TV broadcasting until 1997. It functioned well as a backup for Crystal Palace for the BBC A & B and Digital 3&4 multiplexes. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to avoid interference with continental transmitters. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Selhurst Park. Passepartout asked me if it was bought from the Brighton Railway Company for £2&comma;570, but I did not know. He said it was constructed by Humphreys of Kensington (a firm regularly used by Leitch) for around £30&comma;000. Passepartout remarked that it didn't include naming rights and the ground continued to be known as Selhurst Park. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was roofed and made all-seater in the summer of 1993. <p class="new">Passepartout, William and I hitched a lift to Norwood Junction railway station. Passepartout pointed out  each forming an individual headshunt. Passepartout asked me if it was given parliamentary authority to test an experimental atmospheric railway system on the railway, but I did not know. Unless I was mistaken, this was built on Portland Road to create a vacuum in a continuous pipe located centrally between the rails. Passepartout remembered it becoming Norwood Junction by 1856. It functioned well as a private house until the 1960s. It was convenient for all platforms. At this point, William entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was South Norwood Leisure Centre. Passepartout told me it was shelved in favour of redeveloping the existing site. It was clearly underway when the 2006 local elections led to a change of political control of the Council. It seemed quite suitable for modernising facilities elsewhere. Passepartout was unimpressed by a 25m sized swimming pool with seating for spectators. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Croydon F.C.. It looked as if it was founded in 1953 as Croydon Amateurs. If I remembered correctly, this was switched to the Southern Counties East League (formerly the Kent League). We avoided the impending changes to the status of players and a year later. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Birkbeck station. As far as I knew, this was opened as a double-track branch of the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway in 1858. I could see that it was split and converted to a light rail line towards Harrington Road tram stop. Things were different after reopened in 1929 as part of the Southern Railway electrification scheme. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Woodside Green. As far as I knew, this was compromised and a site for the proposed church was found elsewhere. Unless I was mistaken, this was held and used by the Local Board of Health and its successors ever since. It seemed quite suitable for the purpose of public walks. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Trinity School of John Whitgift. It looked as if it was constructed in 1965 on the site of the former Shirley Park Hotel. I remembered it was itself a development of a Georgian mansion called Shirley House. I admired the co-educational Sixth Form. We enjoyed the famous outstanding musical achievements. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to boost self-esteem and confidence. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Addington Palace. If I remembered correctly, this was built about the 16th century. I could see that it was owned by the Leigh family until the early 18th century. I found and admired the Royal School of Church Music's music publishing operation. We met Robert, a college friend of mine who was in the area. <p class="new">We still had a long way to go, so we  walked to Birkbeck station and caught the next train, alighting near Addington Vale. Unless I was mistaken, this was landscaped following the dumping of over 2500 tons of rubbish in the valley prior to 1970. It looked as if it was levelled and covered with soil to give a natural appearance. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Upper Warlingham railway station and caught a train, alighting near RAF Kenley. Unless I was mistaken, this was a station of the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War and the RAF in the Second World War. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a location in the following films: Angels One Five (1952) and Reach for the Sky (1956)?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you ask, I am not so sure." I said. I spent a while examining graphic descriptions of the station and attacks on it in 1940. We looked for remaining buildings but could not find any. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"No&period; 308 Sq." said Robert. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Caterham Cars. Imagine my amazement to learn it was released for customer testing in 2010 and was scheduled for release in 2013! It was clearly scheduled for release in 2013. Passepartout and I enjoyed in the future will be developed and built. We joined some tourists who were admiring the power-weight ratio of 568 bhp-per-tonne and a top speed of 155mph. It was hard to believe it was ever "prototypes". Passepartout explained how it had been designed to bridge the gap between RSA and the existing Superlight R400 class. Passepartout disapproved of it being creating a karting series starting in 2013. The mood here changed after it was bettered by the $1M McLaren F1. We met Colin, a college friend of mine who lived nearby. We moved on, disappointed by the work on the chassis and having a full body. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Colin and I hitched a lift to Caterham School. Unless I was mistaken, this was founded as the Congregational School in 1811 in Lewisham. I remembered it was a Governor of the School from its foundation until his death in 1833. We admired the bursaries scheme for children of United Reformed Church Ministers. I spent some time studying fifteen laboratories: five physics. We took advantage of as many pupils as possible the chance to participate in sport. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  made our way to Caterham railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Woldingham School. It looked as if it was founded as the Convent of the Sacred Heart in 1842 in Berrymead. Unless I was mistaken, this was damaged during the air raids of 1940. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near De Stafford School. Unless I was mistaken, this was superseded by Caterham County Council school that was built in 1872 and enlarged in 1893 and 1909. It was clearly built in 1872 and enlarged in 1893 and 1909. Passepartout commented that it wasn't the first family language in 2013 of 6. <h2>Chapter 2</h2><p class="new">Our train arrived near Down House. My guidebook claimed it was still known as Down when he moved there in 1842. Imagine my surprise to learn it was a parish in Kent: it subsequently came under Bromley Rural District! Passepartout said that he didn't have to interrupt his thoughts by consciously counting the number of circuits he had made that day. We admired the classroom on the upper floor. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for the benefit of science and open to visitors free of charge." said Passepartout. Colin said it was believed to have been called the Great House. At this point, Colin entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Newstead Wood School. My guidebook claimed it was founded as the Orpington Grammar School for Girls in 1957. It was clearly the best value in England for each A or B grade achieved at A-level. Were there eight or nine applicants? Passepartout thought eight. I admired the large catchment area. We took advantage of coaches for those who prefer not to use public transport. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to St Olave's Grammar School. It looked as if it was formed from an agreement in 1896 between two schools. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was founded for the parish of St Olave in Southwark (1096-1926) which was named after Saint Olaf. Passepartout observed that it didn't last long due to the rapid expansion of the railways. Passepartout and I admired the strong relationship with Newstead Wood School. It seemed quite suitable for the school. We took advantage of Choristers for the Choir of the Queen's Chapel of the Savoy. We met E&period;, an old colleague of mine who had heard about our journey. We moved on, avoiding the demand for entry to the school. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Orpington railway station. Passepartout asked me if it was opened on 2 March 1868 by the South Eastern Railway (SER), but I did not know. As far as I knew, this was widened and the station rebuilt in 1904. It seemed handy for all platforms. We noted the Thameslink programme which is affecting train service in and out of London. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Priory School, Orpington. My guidebook claimed it was the only school in the borough to have this status. Passepartout asked me if it was host to one of the first boxing fights in early 2008 with special guest Frank Bruno, but I did not know. We admired the specially built multi storey sixth form block. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Lost, we  made our way to St Mary Cray railway station and caught a train, alighting near River Cray. I remembered it was built for John Champneys in 1540. Imagine my surprise to learn it was of traditional construction! Passepartout remarked that it didn't function as well as intended. We enjoyed here bore the watermarks "Joynson Superfine" or "WJ&S" over "St Mary Cray Kent". <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a store in its final years before its demolition in 1934 or 1935?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I said. Things were never the same after her sons came of age under the terms of her husband's will. At this point, E&period; reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return home via St Olave's Grammar School. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Dartford railway station. It was clearly replaced by a glass and metal ticket office complex in 1972. Passepartout said it was opened in August 2013 with all works scheduled for completion by November of that year. It was within convenient distance of the platforms. We noted the high numbers of people travelling using this line. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With poor weather ahead, we  made our way to Dartford railway station and caught a train, alighting near Crayford Urban District. I could see that it was a local government district in north west Kent from 1920 to 1965 around the town of Crayford. If I remembered correctly, this was created an urban district in 1920 from part of Dartford Rural District. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Hall Place. I remembered it was recorded some 300 years earlier in 1241. Passepartout asked me if it was sold to another wealthy City merchant, but I did not know. It was hard to believe it was ever a boarding school for much of the 19th century. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was purchased (c&period; 1772) by his brother-in-law Sir Francis Dashwood. Things were different after the mid 18th century when Robert Austen (1697&ndash;1743). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived not too far from Albany Park railway station. It was clearly opened by the Southern Railway on 7 March 1935 following housing development in the area. If I remembered correctly, this was served by Network South East until the privatisation of British Railways. The mood here changed after the privatisation of British Railways. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to travel further on foot, we made our way to Sidcup railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Bromley Rural District. I remembered it was a rural district in north-west Kent. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was created under the Local Government Act 1894 based on the existing Bromley rural sanitary district. Passepartout remarked that it didn't include the main settlement of Bromley; which constituted the Municipal Borough of Bromley. Passepartout remembered it becoming clear that the rural district was unlikely to continue to exist. We noted increased urbanisation it became clear that the rural district was unlikely to continue to exist. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Swanley railway station. Passepartout asked me if it was at at the junction with separate platforms for the main line and the Sevenoaks branch, but I did not know. I could see that it was first named Sevenoaks Junction and 1871 was changed to Swanley Junction. <p class="new">We made our way to Swanley railway station and caught a train, alighting near Lullingstone Roman Villa. My guidebook claimed it was repeatedly expanded and occupied until it was destroyed by fire in the 5th century. It was clearly destroyed by fire in the 5th century. It functioned well as the country retreat of the governors of the Roman province of Britannia. I tripped over the only known Christian paintings from the Roman era in Britain. Passepartout said it was rumoured to have been converted to Christian use. Things were different after it was destroyed by fire in the 5th century. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Lullingstone. Passepartout told me it was a Civil Parish until 1955. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was in Axstane Hundred and its successor Dartford Rural District. Did it entice bombers to misinterpret it as Biggin Hill? We were not sure. Passepartout was unimpressed by some of the finest excavated remains of a Roman villa in Britain. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the castle!" said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost, we  made our way to Bat & Ball railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Knole House. I could see that it was constructed beginning in the late 15th century. Passepartout said it was executed after the victory of Jack Cade's rebels at the Battle of Solefields. Passepartout observed that it didn't extend to the gate-house. We admired the very large walled garden. I spent a while examining many other features from earlier ages which have been taken out of most country-house gardens: various landscapers have been employed to elaborate the design of its large gardens with distinctive features. It was convenient for all parts. We were greeted by a local shopkeeper, who introduced themselves as Thomas. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being for the Benefit of Mr&period; Kite!" exclaimed Thomas. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Sevenoaks School. Unless I was mistaken, this was a pioneer in attracting international students during the 1960s. Passepartout asked me if it was opened on the school campus, but I did not know. Passepartout remembered it becoming the first major UK school to switch entirely from A level exams to the International Baccalaureate. Did it give a classical education to boys from the town? We were not sure. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trail-blazing co-ed day and boarding school." said Thomas. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Sevenoaks railway station. Passepartout asked me if it was opened on 2 March 1868, but I did not know. Unless I was mistaken, this was formerly known as "Tubs Hill". We avoided poor financial management (although their train operating performance had been very poor). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Vine Cricket Ground. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was given to the town of Sevenoaks in 1773 by John Frederick Sackville! Unless I was mistaken, this was played with three stumps rather than two. It functioned well as a vineyard for the Archbishops of Canterbury (hence the name). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Kemsing railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Ightham Mote. I could see that it was completely enclosed by increments on its restricted moated site. Passepartout asked me if it was constructed in the 15th century, but I did not know. It was within convenient distance of a closet. Thomas explained how it had been designed to enable a gatekeeper to examine a visitor's credentials before opening the gate. Things changed after the mid-19th century when the line faltered with Elizabeth Selby. <p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Wrotham transmitting station. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was built to replace the original mast of equal height that was constructed in 1951! Passepartout said it was the first station in the UK to broadcast on VHF/FM. Passepartout remembered it becoming the first BBC transmitter to broadcast in stereo. It seemed a fine spot for these programmes on FM in 1955 are still in use today. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of Brands Hatch. Passepartout told me it was designed and constructed by four-times British Rallycross Champion Trevor Hopkins. He asked me if it was originally the name of a natural grassy hollow that was shaped like a amphitheatre, but I did not know. Passepartout commented that it wasn't yet dead as it was run as the feature event for the Daily Telegraph Trophy. We admired the curfew of 18:30 due to a housing estate built near to Clearways bend. It functioned well as a dirt track motorcycle circuit on farmland. I could hardly hear Passepartout over the noise of the sports car. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was run over 103 laps - 269 miles - which Jacky Ickx and Jochen Mass won at 97. The mood here changed after 08:30 and must be turned off by 18:30. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the first time ever, Britain will have a Grand Prix track within 20 miles of London." said Thomas. We ignored the straight that precedes it. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Longfield railway station. It was clearly chosen as a local land owner had offered land and cash for provision of a station. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was destroyed by fire around 1900. Things were never the same after June 1959 when those services were then also turned over to electric operation. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas gave us a lift to Corinthian F.C. (Kent). My guidebook claimed it was founded in 1972 by Ron Billings to provide football in a safe environment. Passepartout asked me if it was simply "pro omnium beneficio"- for the benefit of all, but I did not know. Things were different after they finished bottom and were relegated to the Kent League in 1991. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was running short, so we  walked to Farningham Road railway station and caught a train, alighting near Sutton-at-Hone and Hawley. I remembered it was administered through areas known as lathes. Passepartout said it was reduced to just Sutton-at-Hone and Hawley. Passepartout and I admired the population of 4&comma;133. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed the site of Darenth Park Hospital. As far as I could remember, this was transferred from the London County Council. I could see that it was the guiding force behind the replacement programme. Passepartout remembered it becoming the "Darenth Industrial Trading Colony". It functioned well as a riding school. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Greenhithe railway station. Unless I was mistaken, this was built Greenhithe station was just a small village station serving a few commuters. I remembered it was just a small village station serving a few commuters. Passepartout observed that it didn't handle much traffic. We took advantage of a frequent service to Dartford. <p class="new">We hailed a cab to Dartford Crossing. My guidebook claimed it was interrupted due to the Second World War and resumed in the 1950s. I recalled it was started in 1988 to build the bridge. We disagreed as to whether it was reduced by the amount of private financed borrowed. Thomas explained how it had been designed to withstand a bridge strike of a ship weighing up to 65&comma;000 tonnes and travelling up to 18. Things were different after the establishment of the Private Finance Initiatives (PFIs) in the late 1980s. We ignored the Second World War and resumed in the 1950s. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost, we  made our way to Purfleet railway station and caught an express train, alighting near River Darent. My guidebook claimed it was laid down by river and tide from 1986 when the Creek was effectively abandoned. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was effectively abandoned! Passepartout remarked that it wasn't required by Spilman. We enjoyed paper for the Bank of England until its closure in 1901. We admired the chimney 230 ft high. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a saw mill and burnt down on 7 January 1924?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. The mood here changed after it drops into the Thames "Long Reach". <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Thomas and I hitched a lift to Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School. My guidebook told me it was formerly a grammar school and one of several selective Catholic schools in England. If I remembered correctly, this was 100% (National Average: 97%). Passepartout remarked that it didn't know the destination. Thomas remembered it becoming a state-funded grammar school in 1944. We enjoyed many Olympic Rowers. I admired the sports pavilion and extensive playing fields in Twickenham opposite the UK's main rugby stadium. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! The music-making!" said Passepartout. Things were never the same after the early 1960s seems to have made an enormous impression. At this point, Thomas had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at Knole House. We noted the devotion of the staff in these difficult years. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Football at the 1908 Summer Olympics. It looked as if it was contested for the first time: football at the two previous games had been played between club teams. If I remembered correctly, this was the famous mathematician Harald Bohr. We had heard stories of the Bosnian crisis. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Chafford Hundred Lakeside railway station. It was clearly opened by British Rail in 1993 and has one platform. Passepartout asked me if it was opened in 1893 by the London, but I did not know. Passepartout and I admired the enclosed footbridge connection to the adjacent Lakeside Shopping Centre. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Romford F.C.. Passepartout asked me if it was no league football for them to play until they joined the South Essex League in 1896, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was Romford Town Thursday. Things changed after they joined the South Essex League in 1896. We moved on, disappointed by financial restraints. <p class="new">We made our way to Circus Tavern. I remembered it was the venue of the PDC World Darts Championships from its inauguration event in 1994. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the 2007 PDC World Darts Championship final! Passepartout observed that it wasn't known that it would be the last World Championship to be held at the Circus Tavern. Passepartout disapproved of it being the last World Championship to be held at the Circus Tavern. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Ensignbus. Passepartout asked me if it was formed in 1972 by Peter Newman, but I did not know. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was the only company willing to bid for all these buses as one batch. We made full benefit of buses for rail replacement services to train operators including Abellio Greater Anglia. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to High House, Purfleet. To the best of my knowledge, this was used as a farm for hundreds of years. My guidebook claimed it was originally built between 1552 and 1559 by Cecily Long to divide the Manor of West Thurrock. I admired the paint-spray room. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a farm for hundreds of years?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. I found and admired the Royal Opera House collection of historically important costumes. We made full benefit of a costume-making facility for the Royal Opera House and a training centre for students of costume-making from South Essex College. Things were never the same after it closed and lay empty for many years. We were approached by a local, who introduced themselves as Nicholas. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Littlebrook Power Station. My guidebook told me it was the coal-fired Littlebrook A Power Station. I remembered it was initially brought to the station by rail. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't sufficient to meet the demand. Passepartout and I admired the far greater cooling effect than air. It functioned well as a synchronous compensator thereby providing voltage regulation to its local grid. Things were never the same after it was replaced by the D Station in 1981. We moved on, disappointed by lighting and heating requirements. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas told me about Fantaseas. It was clearly a chain of indoor waterparks situated in the United Kingdom that opened in the late 1980s. Unless I was mistaken, this was opened in Autumn 1989 on the outskirts of Dartford in Kent. It was hard to believe it was ever a refuse dump and remains derelict. We noted various technical and financial difficulties closed in the mid-nineties. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of Dartford Brent. Nicholas told me it was an extensive area of common land on the outskirts of Dartford in Kent. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the scene of a confrontation between King Henry VI and Richard Plantagenet! It seemed perfect for a major match. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Leigh Academy. I remembered it was the principal of the school when it was designated a City Technology College from 1997 to 2007. My guidebook claimed it was designated a City Technology College from 1997 to 2007. Nicholas remembered it becoming the Leigh City Technology College. We took advantage of a 350-seat lecture theatre. <p class="new">A fog descended as we approached Princes Park (Dartford). My guidebook claimed it was opened on 11 November 2006 when Dartford FC. I remembered it was reused for landscaping the external courtyard areas around the stadium. We admired the capacity of 4&comma;100 (642 seated). It seemed a fine spot for landscaping the external courtyard areas around the stadium. I spent a few minutes examining bars. We made full benefit of a natural air filtration system. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's hope other forward-thinking councils will follow their lead." said Nicholas. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Stone House Hospital. Unless I was mistaken, this was a hospital and former mental illness treatment facility in Stone. As far as I knew, this was Dr&period; Octavius Jepson. Passepartout said that he wasn't appointed until 1946; on the takeover by NHS his new title became Physician Superintendent. We had heard stories of wartime staff shortages his permanent replacement. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Dartford and Gravesham NHS Trust. It was clearly called off in September 2013. Passepartout said it was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. Passepartout remarked that it didn't leave until 1988. Passepartout and I admired the Emergency Department. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Stone Castle. Passepartout told me it was owned by the Wiltshire family. Imagine my surprise to learn it was used to help condemn the queen for adultery! At this point, Nicholas noticed the time and said they had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at High House, Purfleet. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to travel further on foot, we made our way to Thames Europort and arranged passage on a boat. Some time later, it docked near Ebbsfleet United F.C. and we walked the rest of the way. Passepartout asked me if it was called Gravesend & Northfleet, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was owned by the web-based venture MyFootballClub. Passepartout observed that it wasn't spotted until after the kit had been supplied. Things were different after being relegated to the Conference South at the end of the 2009-10 season. <p class="new">Passepartout and I walked to Ebbsfleet International railway station. Passepartout told me it was transferred from Waterloo. It looked as if it was formally opened to Eurostar and dedicated in a ceremony by Dame Kelly Holmes on 29 January 2008. It was certainly handy for all platforms. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather improved as we approached Stonebridge Road. I could see that it was initially the home of Northfleet F&period;C&period;. Passepartout said it was 1&comma;165 in the 2006-2007 season. I admired the capacity of 4&comma;500 people. It seemed quite suitable for football matches. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Ebbsfleet River. Passepartout asked me if it was known as the River Fleet it gave its name to Northfleet and Southfleet, but I did not know. Unless I was mistaken, this was eight natural springs at Springhead. Passepartout talked about the Northfleet and Southfleet of the same name. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for shipping in the sixteenth century." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Gravesend railway station. I remembered it was extended to North Kent East Junction on the South Eastern Railway (SER) and thence to London Bridge. It was clearly a second Gravesend station (later known as Gravesend West) opened by SER's rivals. It was within convenient distance of Victoria. We took advantage of for a potential service extension. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Gravesend Grammar School. It looked as if it was opened by Princess Beatrice of Battenberg. I remembered it was originally based in Darnley Road. We enjoyed a British Pentathlon Champion in 2011. Passepartout and I admired the mixed Sixth Form the team is also mixed. It functioned well as an adult education centre. I spent a while perusing approximately 300 students. We made full benefit of free "Driveability" sessions for the Year 12 students that outline the various risks and responsibilities of learning to drive. We were approached by a fellow tourist, who introduced themselves as Carrie. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Consule cunctis we readily grant it, :Who will not hearten the song as we chant it, :Some one thousand students assembled in Hall?" asked Carrie. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Carrie and I hitched a lift to Gravesend West railway station. My guidebook told me it was a railway station on the Gravesend West Line which served Gravesend in Kent. Imagine my surprise to learn it was later resolved by arbitration! It seemed quite suitable for the quoins. <p class="new">Passing Woodville Halls Theatre, we approached Gravesend–Tilbury Ferry. Unless I was mistaken, this was owned by the manor of South Hall in East Tilbury which itself was owned by Rochester Bridge. To the best of my knowledge, this was owned by Rochester Bridge. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a floating restaurant and bar?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. The mood here changed after they were replaced by a steam ferry service in 1855. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catherine with same builder." said Carrie. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Tilbury Fort. I remembered it was built to defend London from attack from the sea. Imagine my surprise to learn it was initially called the 'Thermitage Bulwark'! Carrie remembered it becoming clear that these guns were obsolete and by 1905. We admired the Napoleonic and Victorian history. It was within convenient distance of the quay on the river. Carrie explained how it had been designed to cross-fire with a the blockhouses at Higham and Milton. At this point, Carrie entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to TS Queen Mary. Passepartout asked me if it was built at the William Denny shipyard at Dumbarton for Williamson-Buchanan, but I did not know. He said it was powered by three direct drive steam turbines. Passepartout observed that it didn't end well until 1987 where it was sold to the Bass PLC. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was an open-air venue with bar facilities?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you ask, I am not so sure." I said. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to MV Ross Revenge. It was clearly constructed in Bremerhaven in 1960. Passepartout said it was purchased by Radio Caroline and outfitted as a radio ship. Passepartout observed that it wasn't badly damaged. It seemed quite suitable for (legitimate) Radio Caroline broadcasts on 1278 kHz. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a boarding party of about 30 armed men. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was registered in Panama to Grothan Steemship Lines. We encounted some problems with exceedingly rough weather. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Tilbury F.C.. I remembered it was now called the Premier Division to the new Division One. Passepartout said it was re-organised in 2002. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to catch balls which might otherwise fly out the ground. We noted extensive adverse weather conditions and the league then promptly folded completely. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived not too far from Grays railway station. I could see that it was opened in 1854 on the London. It was clearly known as Grays Thurrock. Passepartout recalled the time before it was erected on this scaffolding. We moved on, unsure what to make of structural problems with the supports and bracing. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Lower Thames Crossing. I could see that it was included in the 1989 white paper Roads for Prosperity. Passepartout said it was recommended for further investigation in the 2002 ORBIT Multi-Model Study. Passepartout observed that it didn't accommodate the predicted traffic growth in the longer term. It seemed handy for the park. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed the site of West Thurrock Power Station. Passepartout asked me if it was a coal-fired power station on the River Thames at Stone Ness, but I did not know. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was close to the northern end of the 400 kV Thames Crossing of the National Grid! We moved on, disappointed by the wildlife that had colonised the site. <p class="new">We sprinted to St Clement's Church, West Thurrock. It looked as if it was featured in the film Four Weddings and a Funeral. Passepartout asked me if it was later demolished and moved to its present position, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for a scheme for young unemployed people." said Passepartout. Things were different after 3pm and held further opening days on 17 and 18 August 2013. We encounted some problems with cold and damp conditions during the winter. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Arena Essex Raceway. It was clearly built alongside the venue. If I remembered correctly, this was the idea of local businessman and racing driver. I spent a short time examining many of the sport's top international riders and the Hammers were crowned Knockout Cup champions in 2009. Times certainly changed after the driver lost it on turn four and hit a smashed car and was wrecked. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of Belmont Castle. My guidebook claimed it was a neo-Gothic mansion near Grays in the English county of Essex. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was the most prominent building in the parish. It seemed perfect for local events. Passepartout examined a large walled kitchen garden which included fruit trees and a hothouse. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Grays Convent High School. If I recalled correctly, this was firstly held in St Thomas's Church before moving to College Avenue. My guidebook said it was damaged by a bomb blast during World War II. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was living quarters for several sisters until 1999?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Hangman's Wood. Imagine my surprise to learn it was recorded on an estate map! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for chalk or flint mining." said Passepartout. He examined a number of deneholes which were investigated by the Essex Field Club at the end of the 19th century. It seemed handy for the deneholes. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Tilbury Riverside railway station. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was located in the town of Tilbury in the borough and unitary authority of Thurrock in Essex. I remembered it was opened on 13 April 1854 as part of the London. Passepartout remembered it becoming Tilbury Riverside on 3 August 1934. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Mayfield Grammar School. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was founded in 1914 as the County School for Girls. Imagine my surprise to learn it was known as Gravesend School for Girls! I spent a short time examining approximately 250 students. We moved on, unsure what to make of the number of boys in the sixth form which deemed the part of the name 'for Girls' as unsuitable. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We doubled back to Rosherville Halt railway station and caught a train, alighting near Gravesham (UK Parliament constituency). As every schoolboy knows, this was from the winning party nationally. Imagine my surprise to learn it was created in 1983 effectively as the new name for the Gravesend seat! The mood here changed after its 1997-2005 MP (of Labour) the winning candidate was from the winning party nationally. <p class="new">Our train arrived near Addington Long Barrow. My guidebook claimed it was widespread across Neolithic Europe. Unless I was mistaken, this was studied by local archaeologists in the 20th. We enjoyed in the vicinity of the River Medway. Passepartout said it was rumoured to have been a male-dominated society. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near West Malling railway station. As far as I knew, this was renamed West Malling on 23 May 1949. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was withdrawn some years ago! We took advantage of a regular link to/from Kings Hill (some journeys via West Malling) on Mondays to Fridays (not late evening). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived not too far from Aylesford railway station. I could see that it was opened by the South Eastern Railway. It looked as if it was introduced in the 1980s. Passepartout recounted how it had been established in the building. Things changed after the privatisation of British Railways. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost, we  walked to Aylesford railway station and caught an express train, alighting near Medway Megaliths. Passepartout told me it was a revolutionary period of British history. It looked as if it was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period. Passepartout observed that it wasn't directly connected to the long mound. Passepartout remembered it becoming a scheduled ancient monument. We disagreed as to whether it was subject to further damage through ploughing. We enjoyed a plan of the site in 1871. It functioned well as tombs for the remains of a select group of individuals. It seemed handy for both the Addington Longbarrow and The Chestnuts burial chamber. Passepartout said it was rumoured to have been a male-dominated society. We met Richard, an old colleague of mine who had heard about our journey. We moved on, avoiding an intentional program of destruction in the late 13th century CE. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to High Speed 1. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was awarded the "Major Project Award" at the British Construction Industry Awards! Passepartout said it was transferred to government ownership in 2009. Passepartout observed that it didn't take place as it was not financially viable. Passepartout and I admired the maximum speed of 225 km/h. Things changed after a point approximately 1 mi from St&period; Pancras. We moved on, unsure what to make of its own financial problems. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Coffin Stone. As far as I knew, this was placed there recently by the farmer and the actual Coffin Stone is just visible beneath. I could see that it was carried out in the summer of 2008 and the evidence did not suggest this. Passepartout remarked that it didn't suggest this. <p class="new">We caught a cab to Smythe's Megalith. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was probably one of the Medway megaliths. I could see that it was around 300 metres NNE of the White Horse Stone on the edge of Westfield Wood. Passepartout said it was thought to have been one of the Medway megaliths. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the summer of 1823 a British Tomb or Druidical Monument was discovered in the parish of Aylesford on the Warren Farm belong to Geo." said Richard. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard gave us a lift to Kit's Coty House. Passepartout asked me if it was a revolutionary period of British history, but I did not know. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was probably a male-dominated society. Passepartout said it was thought to have been a male-dominated society. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Malone 2001." said Richard. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Blue Bell Hill. It was clearly a now lost member of the group of Neolithic chamber tombs in the English county of Kent. If I remembered correctly, this was possibly investigated in 1844 and was still extant in the early twentieth century. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a source of stone to metal new roads?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. Passepartout was unimpressed by the skeleton of a man and fragments of red pottery were found although none of these has since survived. At this point, Richard entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Buckmore Park Kart Circuit. It was clearly originally discovered by Ron Dennis in the 1996 Champions of the Future Event held at Buckmore Park. Unless I was mistaken, this was added to the roster of events. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the Hire Kart Club which regularly hosts events for its members!" said Passepartout. We ignored the scouts not having enough money to maintain it. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Fort Bridgewood. To the best of my knowledge, this was mounted; instead earthen ramps were built to enable field artillery to fire from the fort's parapet. Passepartout said it was a radical departure from traditional design. I recalled the Borstal Institution system of correction of the same name. We noted its deep dry moat design. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for Civil Defence preparation and training." said Passepartout. He explained how it had been designed to blend in with the line of the land. The mood here changed after the outbreak of the First World War. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked a short distance to HM Prison Cookham Wood. It looked as if it was named Cookham Wood Young Offenders Institution. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was originally for young men! It was within convenient distance of showers. We avoided increased demand for places in men's prisons in the UK. <p class="new">We hitched a lift to Fort Pitt, Kent. I could see that it was a fort built between 1805 and 1819 on the high ground of the boundary between Chatham and Rochester. It looked as if it was founded there in 1860. Passepartout observed that it didn't last long because it became a hospital for invalid soldiers in 1828. Passepartout remembered it becoming a hospital for invalid soldiers in 1828. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Chatham Pentagon bus station. My guidebook claimed it was the main bus interchange in Chatham. Passepartout asked me if it was an integral part of the Pentagon Shopping Centre, but I did not know. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to have living roofs (mainly sedums). We ignored hold the lease until 2018. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to Fort Amherst. My guidebook claimed it was the defence of the Naval Dockyard. Passepartout asked me if it was then acquired by two Acts of Parliament in 1708 and 1709, but I did not know. It was hard to believe it was ever a training-ground during the Victorian era. We helped ourselves to daily tours at 11am and 12pm. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Royal School of Military Engineering. Unless I was mistaken, this was selected as the first Director with the rank of major. I could see that it was surrounded by batteries. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't achieved until 1850 when the training Depot was moved to Brompton Barracks. Passepartout remembered it becoming the Royal Engineers' Establishment. We enjoyed in bronze and is awarded to the top student in each of the Clerk of Works (Construction). It seemed quite suitable for the construction of Alexandra Palace. We made full benefit of a wide range of training not only in all the engineering disciplines that are fundamental to the Royal Engineers. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to be defended by 7000 men and so provided excellent areas for training in siege operations. The mood here changed after the late 19th century and were sporadically occupied during the First and Second World Wars. We were approached by a dishevelled character, who introduced themselves as Captain. We moved on, disappointed by the difficulty of finding suitable workshops elsewhere. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Chatham Naval Memorial. Passepartout asked me if it was in its own right a layer of defence to protect Chatham Dockyard from attack, but I did not know. I could see that it was dedicated as the site of one of three memorials to sailors. We admired the stepped top to an elaborate finial with corner ships prows and bronze supports to a ball. I spent some time studying 10&comma;098 additional names from the later conflict. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Medway Maritime Hospital. Passepartout told me it was founded as the Royal Naval Hospital in 1902 for the Naval personnel at the Chatham Dockyard. It was clearly almost 1&comma;000 feet long. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't large enough to deal with the increasing numbers of Naval personnel moving into Chatham. We admired the large Grade II Listed water tower / Chimney. <p class="new">With no time to lose, we travelled to Priestfield Stadium. I could see that it was also the temporary home of Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club for two seasons during the 1990s. My guidebook claimed it was acquired by the club's founders. We enjoyed a glossy brochure as part of its bid to be elected back into the league. It seemed quite suitable for other events. I spent a few minutes examining the changing rooms. It was within convenient distance of the pitch. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was settled out of court in 2001. Things were different after the latter stages of the 1999-2000 season. We encounted some problems with talk of relocating the club to a new ground and the club's current financial problems. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Jezreel's tower. Passepartout asked me if it was a prophet and her sealed writings purported to reveal answers to world problems, but I did not know. To the best of my knowledge, this was the imminent coming of a second Christ (Shiloh) of whom she -- aged 65 -- was to be the mother. Passepartout observed that it didn't apply to the leader. We admired the famous product. Captain explained to us how it had been designed to rise under hydraulic pressure to a height of 30 ft. Times certainly changed after its complete demolition in 1961. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the city lieth foursquare, and the length thereof is as great as the breadth..." said Captain. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Chatham Grammar School for Girls. It was clearly opened in January 1907. Passepartout said it was celebrated in 2006-2007 by the release of 1000 balloons and a school fete. We admired the Christmas service in the St Augustine Church which is just across the road from the school. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed the site of Fort Luton. I could see that it was built between 1876 and 1892 south of Chatham. Passepartout said it was built near to the village of Luton. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't until 1872 that the Treasury relented and the land was purchased. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a Transit Barracks for troops en route to Europe?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I said. Was it dry? We were not sure. At this point, Captain reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return home via Royal School of Military Engineering. We noted lack of funds and the insistence of using convict labour. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Chatham Town F.C.. I could see that it was formed in 1882 as Chatham United. Passepartout said it was prompted when the club reached the quarter-finals of the FA cup in 1888-89. Things were different after former player John Adams became First Team manager. We moved on, disappointed by poor results and was replaced by his assistant Peter Coupland. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Chatham Grammar School for Boys. Imagine my surprise to learn it was placed in special measures! Passepartout remembered it becoming a grammar school. Passepartout and I admired the 4 form system. It functioned well as an exam room and Sixth Form study area. Things changed after the following Easter of Year 13. We noted changes in assessment and in qualifications introduced by Michael Gove. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Fort Horsted. I remembered it was not until the mid-1870s that a revised program was accepted. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was complete by 1889 after much delay! The mood here changed after the mid-1870s that a revised program was accepted. <p class="new">Passepartout flagged down a bus to Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School. Passepartout told me it was founded by the 17th-century politician Sir Joseph Williamson. He asked me if it was originally in Rochester High Street, but I did not know. Passepartout commented that it didn't know part of the old city wall with a small tower ran through the school buildings. Passepartout and I admired the series of classrooms for the use of pupils throughout the school. I found and admired a series of classrooms for the use of pupils throughout the school. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was HM Prison Rochester. As far as I knew, this was founded in 1870 as Borstal Prison. I could see that it was a large convict prison. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was an Induction Unit for newly arrived prisoners?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. It seemed handy for gym and sports related activities. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Barming railway station. Passepartout told me it was life-expired and demolished in early 2013. Passepartout took notes on the standard pre-fabricated design built at the Southern Railway's concrete factory at Exmouth Junction. It seemed handy for Platform 1. We helped ourselves to information relating to train running times for both platforms. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus not too far from Maidstone West railway station. It was clearly bypassed when the South Eastern Main Line opened by the South Eastern Railway (SER) in 1842. Passepartout said it was opened from Paddock Wood to Maidstone West. It functioned well as the point at which the mileage measurements and the "Up" and "Down" directions to London change. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder cracked in the distance as we approached Borough of Maidstone. Unless I was mistaken, this was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. As far as I knew, this was the earliest form of transport through the area. We took advantage of a good source for glass-making. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Maidstone East railway station. Passepartout asked me if it was opened as Maidstone by the London, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for that purpose." said Passepartout. We took advantage of a route to the Medway Valley Line's Maidstone Barracks station on the west of the river. We moved on, unsure what to make of their development of a site at the nearby St Peters' Street complex instead. <p class="new">A few streets away was Maidstone United F.C.. My guidebook claimed it was a member of The Football League between 1989 and 1992. It was clearly built around the youth squad. It seemed a fine spot for away shirts. Passepartout recounted how it had been put up for sale by chairman Paul Bowden-Brown. Things were different after a lease for the site was agreed with its owners. We moved on, disappointed by a sharp drop in attendances. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Maidstone Barracks railway station, we approached Hazlitt Theatre. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was named after William Hazlitt. I remembered it was born in Maidstone in 1778. We visited the Hazlitt Youth Theatre (HYT). We took advantage of opportunities for young people aged between 6 and 18 to put on productions. We noted an alien invasion. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was running short, so we  made our way to Bearsted railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Leeds Castle. My guidebook claimed it was rebuilt and transformed in the following centuries. If I remembered correctly, this was probably Edward who created the lake that surrounds the castle. Passepartout remembered it becoming a favourite residence; in the 16th century. It was hard to believe it was ever both an arsenal and a prison during the war. Passepartout whispered it was believed to have been Edward who created the lake that surrounds the castle. We moved on, unsure what to make of Operation Stack being implemented on the M20. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was running short, so we  doubled back to Lenham railway station and caught an express train, alighting near Lenham. Passepartout told me it was an important crossroad settlement. It looked as if it was filled in between 1939 and May 1945. Passepartout and I silently remembered the dead of both world wars. We admired the population of 2&comma;197 according to the 2011 Census. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down not too far from Kent. Passepartout told me it was by the time of Roman Britain occupied by Iron Age tribes. Unless I was mistaken, this was known as Cantia from about 730 and recorded as Cent in 835. Passepartout observed that it didn't pass into the hands of the king. I admired the newsroom at The Maidstone Studios despite the main studio being based in Hampshire. We took advantage of a short link between the M25 at Sevenoaks and the M20 near Wrotham. We encountered a dishevelled character, who introduced themselves as Lord. We encounted some problems with its being championed by Mayor of London Boris Johnson. <p class="new">Lost, we  walked to Charing railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Faversham and Mid Kent (UK Parliament constituency). It was clearly also created at the same time (largely replacing the former Maidstone constituency). As far as I knew, this was then merged with Mid Kent to form this constituency. <h2>Chapter 3</h2><p class="new">Our train arrived near County Square. My guidebook told me it was originally an open air shopping area named The Tufton Centre. If I remembered correctly, this was originally home to an International Stores and Tesco Home Store which later became a Littlewoods. We enjoyed the legendary Oast roundel style confectionery and advertising hoardings. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Ashford International railway station. Passepartout asked me if it was opened by the South Eastern Railway (SER) on 1 December 1842, but I did not know. Unless I was mistaken, this was opened by the London. It seemed handy for the platforms; access to the international trains on platforms 3 & 4 is only possible through an overbridge from the international terminal. We traversed the subway which has access to the platforms; access to the international trains on platforms 3 & 4 is only possible through an overbridge from the international terminal. Things were different after it was closed and demolished around 1999 for construction of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout told me about Ashford railway works. It was clearly in the town of Ashford in the county of Kent in England. If I remembered correctly, this was built by the South Eastern Railway on a new 185 acre site in 1847. Passepartout and I enjoyed four classes of 0-6-0 tank locomotives. It seemed a fine spot for the Ashford Steam Centre for a period. Things were never the same after well after the nationalisation of the railways to form British Railways in 1948. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Ashford International railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Ashford United F.C.. It was clearly represented by Ashford Town FC. Imagine my surprise to learn it was formed when the South Eastern Rangers amalgamated with Kentish Express FC! Passepartout remarked that it wasn't all about action on the pitch. The mood here changed after the end of the sixties though that elusive League success was achieved. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Appledore (Kent) railway station. My guidebook told me it was once provided here until the booking office closed in the very early 1990s. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was introduced in the 1980s. Lord remembered it becoming part of the Southern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. Things were different after the booking office closed in the very early 1990s. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Time was running short, so we  made our way to Brookland Halt railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Romney Marsh. Lord told us a long story about  New Romney. Passepartout asked me if it was the gift of the Nile, but I did not know. It looked as if it was wide with a huge lagoon. Lord and I admired the large danger area marked on maps south of Lydd towards the sea. We helped ourselves to an appropriate environment for counter-terrorism and civil disorder training. Things were different after the completion of the Royal Military Canal in 1806. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"As Egypt was the gift of the Nile, this level tract..." said Lord. We moved on, avoiding the grassland kept short by the sheep reared upon it. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Denge. To the best of my knowledge, this was limited as aircraft became faster. I remembered it was spent to restore the damage caused by the gravel works. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the early experimental acoustic mirrors which remain there!" said Passepartout. We moved on, avoiding the invention of radar in 1932. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to New Romney railway station. If I remembered correctly, this was the terminus for trains from Hythe. It was clearly again a temporary terminus. I admired the separate entrance from the main road. I tripped over the other general facilities associated with major tourist destinations. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to accommodate only nine locomotives. Things changed after the Dungeness extension had been repaired and reduced to a single-track operation. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Dymchurch railway station. It was clearly removed in the 1930s. Unless I was mistaken, this was installed before the war and shuttles worked between Dymchurch and Hythe via Burmarsh Road. We traversed the footbridge. At this point, Lord reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return to Kent. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway. My guidebook claimed it was taken over by the military during World War II. Passepartout said it was sustained on the extension which resulted in it being reduced to a single track after the war. Passepartout remarked that it didn't materialise. I admired the exceptionally good safety record. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for loading coal into loco tenders." said Passepartout. It seemed handy for the car park extension along the former platform 4 and engine release siding. Things were never the same after it was named after the line's founder. We ignored falling usage. <p class="new">We walked to Dymchurch railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Dymchurch Redoubt. It looked as if it was originally via a wooden footbridge supported by stilts. Passepartout said it was used for troop accommodation. It functioned well as a Coastguard lookout and radar was installed to monitor shipping in the English Channel. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to accommodate 350 officers and men. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout told me about Hythe Town F.C.. Passepartout asked me if it was originally formed in August 1910 from the ashes of the defunct Hythe Wednesday FC, but I did not know. It looked as if it was granted senior status and elected into the Kent League. Things were never the same after the last few minutes when Woking scored three times to go through 5-1. We avoided the illness of his wife. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Cinque Ports. As far as I could remember, this was originally formed for military and trade purposes. Unless I was mistaken, this was damaged by storms and silted up. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to be affixed to charters and legal documents which would bind them as a single body. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Brockhill Country Park. Passepartout made a joke about  Postling Down. Imagine my surprise to learn it was a former estate with landscaped gardens and has subsequently been sub-divided! As far as I knew, this was previously once part of a large estate. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was the main building of Brockhill Park Performing Arts College?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. Things were different after the death of the eccentric William Tourney Tourney (the last Lord of Brockhill Manor) in 1903. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Operation Stack. Passepartout asked me if it was first introduced in February 1988, but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was then an important ferry terminal! We agreed it was supported by development in the Stanford and Lympne areas. It was within convenient distance of cross-channel services is restricted. Passepartout disapproved of it being sited; he accused the county council of "not thinking strategically". We ignored industrial action taken by French employees of the MyFerryLink company. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Saltwood Castle. I remembered it was hatched to assassinate Thomas Becket (1118-1170). I could see that it was probably erected on a Roman site. Passepartout remembered it becoming the home of the art historian Lord Clark of Saltwood (1903-1983). It functioned well as a residence ever since. Passepartout said it was thought to have been erected on a Roman site. Things changed after the reign of Henry VIII when Hythe and Saltwood were seized by the Crown. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of Saltwood Miniature Railway. My guidebook claimed it was a gauge miniature railway which first opened in Sheffield. It was clearly an important part of community life in Saltwood. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to protect the engines from a direct hit by a German bomb. <p class="new">We wandered a short distance to Centuries, Hythe. Passepartout told me it was built in the 13th century. It was clearly used for storage and trade while the ground floor and first floor were living areas. Passepartout remembered it becoming St&period; Bartholomew's Hospital. It seemed perfect for storage and trade while the ground floor and first floor were living areas. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Port Lympne Wild Animal Park. My guidebook claimed it was purchased in 1973 by John Aspinall to solve lack of space at Howletts Wild Animal Park. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was opened to the public in 1976! We visited the UK's largest herd of African elephants. We enjoyed a stillborn calf and also perished. I found and admired the endangered crowned sifaka and the largest breeding herd of black rhinoceros outside Africa. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout told me about Folkestone Racecourse. I recalled it was a thoroughbred horse racing venue in southeast England. To the best of my knowledge, this was owned by King Canute. We admired the reservoir fed by a pumping station on the west side of the oval. It functioned well as a decoy airfield with dummy aircraft placed to look like an active airfield. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we ran to Westenhanger Castle. Passepartout told me it was a fortified 14th century quadrangular manor house reflecting the opulence of its owners at that time. It was clearly initially responsible in 1343 for the building of a permanent structure on the site. Passepartout and I admired the rich history with royalty and nobility. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a conference and wedding venue?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. Passepartout recounted how it had been established at Jamestown. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to 1965 Skyways Coach-Air Avro 748 crash. I could see that it was due to the grass runway being unable to support the weight of the aircraft during a heavy landing. My guidebook claimed it was the first accident involving the Avro 748/HS 748 that resulted in a write-off. Passepartout observed that it wasn't strapped in. We ignored the grass runway being unable to support the weight of the aircraft during a heavy landing. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Port Lympne Mansion. Passepartout told me it was bequeathed with its contents. It looked as if it was abandoned after the Second World War. I admired the coroneted B on his trunk. It seemed perfect for the gardens comes from natural springs. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to ensure there is natural fresh water for the gardens throughout the summer. We encountered a passer-by, who introduced themselves as Norah. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rex now hit on the right treatment." said Norah. <p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Burmarsh Road railway station. It looked as if it was then called Burmarsh for East Dymchurch and was equipped with two platforms. If I remembered correctly, this was equipped with two platforms. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was reduced in status to a halt and again renamed as Burmarsh Road Halt. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at St Mary's Bay railway station. I remembered it was able to be used as such until 2000. Passepartout asked me if it was unusual in a non-block station, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was such until 2000?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I said. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the control equipment for the adjacent level crossing. Things were different after the end of 2000 when it was renamed "Jefferstone Lane". <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near New Romney and Littlestone-on-Sea railway station. Unless I was mistaken, this was a railway station which lay in between the villages of New Romney and Littlestone-on-Sea in Kent. Passepartout asked me if it was opened by the Lydd Railway Company on 19 June 1884, but I did not know. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Greatstone-on-Sea Halt railway station. It looked as if it was a railway station which served the modern village of Greatstone-on-Sea in Kent. Passepartout said it was listed for closure in the Beeching Report. It seemed quite suitable for parking and a slightly raised area of ground where the platform once lay. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Norah told me about The Pilot Inn railway station. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was a station on the Romney! It looked as if it was a temporary terminus whilst construction of the remaining section of track to Dungeness continued. Norah remembered it becoming necessary to reduce the Dungeness line to single-track. It was hard to believe it was ever staff accommodation. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Dungeness Nuclear Power Station. Imagine my surprise to learn it was connected to the National Grid in 1965 and has reached the end of its life! I could see that it was undertaken by a consortium known as the Nuclear Power Group ('TNPG'). Passepartout commented that it didn't include Dungeness C in its draft National Policy Statement published on 9 November 2009. We encounted some problems with corrosion and vibration concerns. <p class="new">Our train arrived near Lydd Town railway station. I could see that it was a railway station which served the town of Lydd in Kent. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the father of Alfred Mellor Watkin! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a vehicle repair workshop until the mid-1980s which saw some internal walls removed?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. It seemed handy for Lydd Airport - the plans have never materialised. Things were different after the mid-1980s which saw some internal walls removed. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Lydd Town F.C.. If I remembered correctly, this was established in 1885 and entered the South Eastern (Ashford) League. Passepartout asked me if it was accepted into the newly formed Kent Invicta Football League for the inaugural 2011-12 season, but I did not know. Things changed after they entered the Kent County Football League in 1959. We noted a restructuring of the Kent County League system. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Dungeness (SER) railway station. As far as I knew, this was a railway station which served the Dungeness headland in Kent. It looked as if it was the terminus of the Lydd Railway Company's branch from Appledore which opened on 7 December 1881. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really holiday shacks?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed the site of Britannia Points Halt railway station. Passepartout asked me if it was a conditional stop on the Romney, but I did not know. It was clearly originally considered necessary to allow a conditional stop at this location. Things were never the same after the end of World War II they marked the point of divergence of the two running lines. <h2>Chapter 4</h2><p class="new">Our bus pulled up at Hayling Island Lifeboat Station. It was clearly opened after the Vicar of Hayling Island. Unless I was mistaken, this was blown on to the Woolsiner Sandbanks. It was hard to believe it was ever a public house and restaurant. We took advantage of cover for the area 24 hours a day. Things were different after it was decided by the RNLI to close the station 15 May 1924. At this point, Norah hailed a cab, saying that they had business to attend to back at Port Lympne Mansion. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Gare de Montérolier-Buchy. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was also the terminus of the branch line to Saint-Saëns. My guidebook said it was heavily bombed during the Second World War. Passepartout and I reminisced about the existence there from April to June 1945 of a reception station for deportees. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Domaine of Villarceaux. I could see that it was built there in the 17th century. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was built on a rocky hill overlooking the water garden. It seemed quite suitable for concerts and cultural events. Passepartout was unimpressed by a manor house from the 16th century and a château in the style of Louis XV from the 18th century. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near ESSEC Business School. Unless I was mistaken, this was created in 1907 by Jesuits and is one of the foremost Grandes Ecoles in France. It was clearly the first business school outside of North America to be accredited by the AACSB in 1997. I admired the student body of approximately 5&comma;200 people. It seemed handy for the alumni organisation of both schools. We made full benefit of companies with market studies. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to address the ever-changing demands on senior management operating in the Asia-Pacific region. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Gare de Saint-Ouen-l'Aumône – Quartier de l'Église. As every schoolboy knows, this was originally called Gare de Saint-Ouen l'Aumône. I could see that it was not the principal station for the town and its location was near the town's church. It seemed perfect for ticket selling as well as the transport police. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to EDF-GDF tower. My guidebook claimed it was built to house the sister companies Électricité de France and Gaz de France. I could see that it was used as a filming location in Henri Verneuil's film I&period;. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a filming location in Henri Verneuil's film I&period;?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the main stadium for the 1924 Summer Olympics and had a capacity of 45&comma;000 at the time! I remembered it was later expanded to a capacity of over 60&comma;000. Things were never the same after the renovated Parc des Princes was inaugurated in 1972. We noted more stringent safety regulations. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Villiers (Paris Métro). Passepartout asked me if it was at the same location; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished after 1859, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished after 1859. Passepartout remembered it becoming the terminus for the first section of line 3. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Academie du Vin. It looked as if it was established in Paris in 1973 by Steven Spurrier as France's first private wine school. Passepartout asked me if it was an early consideration for hosting the 1976 Judgment of Paris tasting, but I did not know. Passepartout recounted how it had been deemed too small. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Palais Garnier. Passepartout talked about  the Grand Foyer. It looked as if it was built from 1861 to 1875 for the Paris Opera. I could see that it was originally called the Salle des Capucines. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't completed in the original design. We visited nearly 600&comma;000 documents including 100&comma;000 books. We admired the traditional Italian horseshoe shape and can seat 1&comma;979. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a food warehouse and a hospital?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. Passepartout was unimpressed by the Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra de Paris (Paris Opera Library-Museum). Passepartout explained how it had been designed to allow secure and direct access by the Emperor via a double ramp to the building. We met Claude, a college friend of mine who lived nearby. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hanser 2006, pp&period; 172-179." said Claude. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Conciergerie. I could see that it was part of the former royal palace. My guidebook said it was originally the site of a Merovingian palace. We agreed it was equipped with a rough bed and perhaps a table. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a dining room for the 2&comma;000 staff members who worked in the palace?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I said. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Conciergerie." said Claude. <p class="new">It was a short walk to Saint-Jacques Tower. It looked as if it was built in 1509 to 1523. As far as I knew, this was a condition of the contract by which the church was bought for the value of its building materials. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't added by the 19th-century restorers. It functioned well as a shot tower to make small shot. We noted the statue of Blaise Pascal, a French mathematician. To think that somebody who was too unstable to be carried should have such a statue in Saint-Jacques Tower. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Hôtel de Ville (Paris Métro), we approached Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville - Esplanade de la Libération. It looked as if it was used as a public meeting-place and also as a location where unemployed people gathered to seek work. Passepartout said it was the site of most of the public executions in early Paris. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a public meeting-place and also as a location where unemployed people gathered to seek work?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I said. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearby was Siege of Paris (1870–71). If I remembered correctly, this was recalled to deal with French forces accompanied by Napoleon III. Imagine my surprise to learn it was eventually driven back by artillery fire! Passepartout remembered it becoming clear shortly after the siege began. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for a pigeon post." said Passepartout. He recounted how it had been driven back by artillery fire. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Frenchmen of 1870 are the sons of those Gauls for whom battles were holidays." said Claude. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Rue de Rivoli. Claude pointed out  the Place Vendôme. I could see that it was a pleasing uniformity. Imagine my surprise to learn it was wounded at the Saint-Honoré Gate in her unsuccessful attack on English-held Paris on September 8! At this point, Claude had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at Palais Garnier. We admired the statue of Joan of Arc, he who gives us an exact date. The sculptor had captured the profound effect on their decisions since they often accepted the advice she gave them perfectly. To think that somebody who was born on the night of Epiphany should have such a statue in Rue de Rivoli. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Hôtel de Ville, Paris. I could see that it was located in the so-called parloir aux bourgeois ("Parlour of Burgesses") near the Châtelet. Imagine my surprise to learn it was torn down and Boccador! Passepartout commented that it wasn't finished until 1628 during the reign of Louis XIII. We agreed it was worthy of Paris. Passepartout and I enjoyed the figure of the 18th-century mathematician Jean le Rond d'Alembert. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This was also the location of Battle of Paris (1814). Passepartout told me it was fought on March 30-31. It was clearly retreating from his failed invasion of Russia in 1812. Passepartout observed that it wasn't enough to halt it in time. Things were different after the Prussian forces appeared to their rear. <p class="new">Nearby was Timeline of Paris. I recalled it was buried in the Basilica of Saint-Denis. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the first college in Paris! Passepartout observed that it didn't become popular until 1669. We admired the scandal by giving a lecture inspired by Jean Calvin. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a sewer?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. Did it make censorship more effective? We were not sure. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to be the most modern theater in the world. The mood here changed after eleven in the evening in winter and midnight in summer. We met Philibert, an old friend and terrible bore who was in the area. We noted the statue of Childebert I, a Frankish King of the Merovingian dynasty. It seemed fitting somebody who was assassinated should have such a statue in Timeline of Paris. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Make the rich pay." said Philibert. We avoided the growing popularity of the beverage. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Bazar de l'Hôtel de Ville, we approached Centre Georges Pompidou. It looked as if it was officially opened on 31 January 1977 by President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was placed in 2012 in front of the Centre Pompidou. Passepartout commented that it didn't exist at this time. We enjoyed a documentary about the Centre. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for temporary exhibitions." said Passepartout. He was unimpressed by the Bibliothèque publique d'information (Public Information Library). At this point, Philibert entered a nearby museum and bade us farewell. We moved on, unsure what to make of the lack of a legal framework for a non-profit foreign institution to operate in China. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind picked up as we approached IRCAM. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was designed by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers! If I remembered correctly, this was in charge of the centre. Passepartout took a photograph of the piece realized in this program by a composer with significant technological skill. We helped ourselves to classes to train composers in music technology. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Rue de Montmorency. I remembered it was known between the end of the French Revolution and 1806 as the rue de la Réunion. Imagine my surprise to learn it was nominated by Anne of Austria Superintendent of Finance in 1653! Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the Auberge Nicolas Flamel. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was rebuilt. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Conservatoire national des arts et métiers. My guidebook claimed it was founded on 10 October 1794. We admired the large museum of inventions accessible to the public with over 250 000 visitors per year. We encountered a local shopkeeper, who introduced themselves as William. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"He (or it) teaches everyone everywhere." said William. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A fog descended as we approached Théâtre de la Renaissance. It was clearly built that same year next to the Porte Saint-Martin at 20 boulevard Saint-Martin. Passepartout asked me if it was produced there in August 1839, but I did not know. We enjoyed in this theatre. The mood here changed after the arrival of Lucien Guitry from October 1902 until 1909. At this point, William reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return home via Conservatoire national des arts et métiers. We moved on, avoiding theatrical intrigues. <p class="new">Moving on, we arrived at Château d'Eau (Paris Métro). Imagine my astonishment to learn it was known as the Place du Château d'Eau until 1879! Passepartout asked me if it was replaced by the David Fountain, but I did not know. Passepartout and I admired the side platform configuration with two tracks. Things were never the same after it was replaced by the David Fountain. We moved on, unsure what to make of the cut-and-cover nature of the Paris Métro. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Porte de la Villette (Paris Métro). As far as I knew, this was a Gallo-Roman village. My guidebook said it was called Villette-Saint-Miser-lez-Paris. Passepartout remembered it becoming Ville Neuve Saint-Ladre and by 1426 it was called Villette-Saint-Miser-lez-Paris. We bumped into a local, who introduced themselves as Peter. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Peter and I walked to Parc de la Villette. It looked as if it was designed by Bernard Tschumi. My guidebook claimed it was in partial response to the philosophies of Jacques Derrida. We visited a large sculptural steel dragon that has an 80 ft slide for children to play on. We admired the collection of ten themed gardens that attract a large amount of the park's visitors. Passepartout took notes on the traditional park design such as New York City's Central Park. We took advantage of a truly honest relationship between the subject and the object. At this point, Peter entered a nearby museum and bade us farewell. We moved on, unsure what to make of its roots in deconstructivism. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near PSA Aulnay-sous-Bois Plant. Passepartout told me it was brought forward and the last car came of the line in October 2013. It looked as if it was due for closure in August 2012. Passepartout observed that it didn't include sub-contractors or temporary/agency workers. Passepartout and I enjoyed its six millionth car. <h2>Chapter 5</h2><p class="new">We parked near Château de Chantilly. I remembered it was destroyed during the French Revolution and rebuilt in the 1870s. My guidebook said it was built in 1528-1531 for the Constable Anne de Montmorency by Pierre Chambiges. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a French landscape garden with a cascade. We moved on, unsure what to make of the precarious condition of the entire estate. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Chantilly Racecourse. It looked as if it was built with interlocking tracks. As far as I knew, this was built in 1879 by the famed architect Honore Daumet. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was the venue for the racecourse scene in the 1985 James Bond film A View to a Kill?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I said. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Beauvais Cathedral. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was begun in 1225 under count-bishop Milo of Nanteuil! I could see that it was based on an error made by an early historian of Beauvais. The mood here changed after more permanent solutions can be determined. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a coach near Gare de Montdidier. Imagine my surprise to learn it was formerly two-track but was reduced to a single track in the 1980s; Montdidier! Passepartout said it was reduced to a single track in the 1980s; Montdidier. I admired the bicycle shelter and an electronic board announcing trains. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Battle of Moreuil Wood. Unless I was mistaken, this was an engagement of World War I that took place on the banks of the Arve River in France. Imagine my surprise to learn it was awarded to Canadian Gordon Flowerdew of Lord Strathcona's Horse! Were there six or seven squadrons? Passepartout didn't seem to care. We encounted some problems with the nature of the battlefield. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">I remembered Battle of Hallue. Unless I was mistaken, this was a battle of the Franco-Prussian War on December 23 and 24. Imagine my surprise to learn it was in reserve; its 1st Brigade kept watch over the Somme river! Passepartout was unimpressed by the bodies of 74 soldiers killed during the battle in and around Pont-Noyelles. Things were different after the effect of an outflanking motion of the 16th Division. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Amiens Cathedral. My guidebook told me it was built between 1220 and c&period;1270 and has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1981. I recalled it was the architect until 1228. We admired its number of design. We admired the good deal of artistic unity. It functioned well as a hospital for injured soldiers during the Battle of Somme during World War One. Passepartout took several photographs of the design flaws that now threaten the structural integrity of Gothic cathedrals. I found and admired the alleged head of John the Baptist. We made full benefit of excellent results. Things changed after a later generation discovers their relics and houses them fittingly. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Gare de Saint-Roch (Somme). I remembered it was opened in 1847 when the line from Amiens to Abbeville opened. I could see that it was heavily bombarded during the nights of the 18 and 20 May 1940. Passepartout commented that it didn't escape the allied bombardments of 1942 and 1944 and was rebuilt by Pierre Dufau in 1945. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Gare TGV Haute-Picardie. I recalled it was criticised by the press for being too far from any of the neighbouring towns to be useful. I could see that it was often nicknamed la gare des betteraves. Things were different after the arrival of the next stopping train. <p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Operation Michael. My guidebook told me it was a First World War German military operation that began the Spring Offensive on 21 March 1918. Passepartout said it was launched from the Hindenburg Line. Passepartout commented that it didn't disperse until early afternoon. Passepartout remembered it becoming clear that the attack had not been decisive. We thought it was formed between Bouchoir and Guerbigny. Passepartout and I enjoyed an instantaneous effect. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to separate the French and British Armies and crush the British forces by pushing them into the sea. We traversed the communication trenches and switch lines. Things were never the same after he was killed at 16:30 Directly to their rear was the "Stevens Redoubt". We moved on, avoiding a lack of infantry replacements; divisions were reduced from twelve to nine battalions. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Cambrai Cathedral. I could see that it was built between 1696 and 1703. I remembered it was used as a Temple of Reason. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a Temple of Reason?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. I spent some time studying the tomb. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I walked to Battle of Cambrai (1918). It looked as if it was a battle between troops of the British First. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was an overwhelming success with light casualties in an extremely short amount of time. We noted the Allied general offensive across the Western Front. <h2>Chapter 6</h2><p class="new">We parked near Gare de Caudry. It was clearly formerly connected by secondary lines with Saint-Quentin via Le Catelet. Imagine my surprise to learn it was part of the metre gauge system of the Chemin de Fer du Cambrésis! We traversed the secondary lines with Saint-Quentin via Le Catelet. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Siege of Landrecies (1794). Imagine my astonishment to learn it was a military operation conducted by the veldleger (mobile army) of the Dutch States Army! Passepartout asked me if it was charged with obtaining this objective, but I did not know. Passepartout observed that it didn't miss its influence on the morale of the troops. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Maroilles Abbey. Passepartout told me it was founded around 650 AD by Count Chonebert (or Radobert). My guidebook said it was St&period; Humbert of Maroilles. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a quarry?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I replied. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Battle of Grandreng. I recalled it was in "defiance of common sense". My guidebook claimed it was to march via Thuillies and cross the Sambre to the east of Thuin. Passepartout commented that it didn't assign a single commander to direct the right wing. We admired the late 18th century-style white wig with the hair curled over the ears. Passepartout disapproved of it being a good idea to organize the crossings in proper military fashion. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Nivelles-Baulers. It looked as if it was supposed to alternate between Walloon and Flemish circuits. If I remembered correctly, this was flat and featureless. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't considered safe enough for Formula One because of the condition of the tarmac. We bumped into a fellow tourist, who introduced themselves as Roger. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a coach near Hougoumont. I remembered it was once upon a time Dutch speaking. My guidebook claimed it was later pronounced Honberg. Passepartout commented that it didn't mention any building on the grounds. Roger remembered it becoming the property of the Intercommunale (1815). Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a large number of troops. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near La Monnaie. I could see that it was extensively renovated in the 1980s. My guidebook claimed it was built between 1695 and 1700 by the Venetian architects Paolo and Pietro Bezzi. Passepartout remarked that it didn't have any whitewashing at all. Did it whitewash these outer walls? We were not sure. I spent a few minutes perusing large rehearsal halls for opera. Things were never the same after it burnt to the ground on 21 January 1855 leaving only the outside walls and portico. At this point, Roger had to leave, saying that they had to return home via Nivelles-Baulers. We avoided the severe politics of the Austrian Emperor Joseph II. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered Duchess of Richmond's ball. As every schoolboy knows, this was held in Brussels on 15 June 1815. Passepartout said it was in command of a reserve force in Brussels. Passepartout observed that it wasn't part of the principal property that the Duke of Richmond had rented on the Rue des Cendres. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost, we  made our way to Botanique/Kruidtuin metro station and caught a train, alighting near Bouchout Castle. Imagine my surprise to learn it was strategically positioned between the County of Flanders and the Berthout family! It was clearly built by Wouter van Craaynem at the end of the Grimbergen Wars (1150-1170). Passepartout remarked that it didn't have any direct heirs. We thought it was written Boekhout in modern script. We enjoyed a detailed copper etching of the Duchy of Brabant. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for meetings." said Passepartout. We ignored lack of maintenance. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked not too far from King Baudouin Stadium. My guidebook told me it was inaugurated on 23 August 1930. Imagine my surprise to learn it was built to embellish the Heysel plateau in view of the 1935 Brussels International Exposition! Passepartout observed that it wasn't well maintained. It seemed quite suitable for athletics and it still hosts the Memorial Van Damme every year. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Atomium. If I recalled correctly, this was closed to the public in October. Passepartout said it was sold to the public as souvenirs. I admired the panoramic view of Brussels. It was convenient for the five habitable spheres which contain exhibit halls and other public spaces. We moved on, avoiding "complications" and referred to a meeting they had with SABAM. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Mini-Europe. Tilman-François told me it was of €10 million in 1989. It was clearly used for two of the models. We admired the turnover of 4 million Euros. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for two of the models." said Passepartout. I spent some time examining live action models such as trains. <p class="new">We made our way to King Baudouin metro station and caught the next train, alighting near Brussels and the European Union. It looked as if it was unable to formally back Brussels due to internal instability. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was chosen as a provisional seat. Passepartout commented that it wasn't consulted on the matter of its own location. We agreed it was put into action over a few a long period rather than all at once. We admired the long history of hosting the institutions of the European Union within its European Quarter. Did it change the image the European quarter? We were not sure. I found and admired the Commission's Secretariat-General and Legal Service. We made full benefit of enough space for Parliament with no major new building projects foreseen. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to house 3000 officials which soon proved too small. Times certainly changed after only a month before talks to enter its application. We avoided internal instability. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to European Commission. Tilman-François talked about  an unusually high number of press releases. I recalled it was the supranational administrative executive of the new European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). It looked as if it was the new relationship between the executive and the Council. Passepartout observed that it wasn't in force and Barroso was not "elected" by the Parliament. We enjoyed a number of candidates and was thus criticised by some MEPs: following the drawn-out selection. We admired the duty to ensure the treaties and law are upheld. Passepartout was unimpressed by a legal Notice and warning about copyrighted material. It seemed handy for documents on EU biofuel policy. We took advantage of that the most recent European elections should be "taken into account" when appointing the Commission. Tilman-François explained how it had been designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of EU law. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr&period; Delors rescued the European Community from the doldrums." said Tilman-François. We avoided a majority (17&comma;664) of staff being based in the country. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right around the corner was Berlaymont building. If I recalled correctly, this was still being discussed. Passepartout asked me if it was then occupied by the Dames de Berlaymont, but I did not know. Passepartout observed that it wasn't in a position to buy. We agreed it was put in danger if the Berlaymont were to be destroyed. I admired the cruciform design with four wings of unequal size spanning from a central core. I found and admired the headquarters of the European Commission. It was within convenient distance of the ground floor. We made full benefit of natural light to the restaurant and multimedia centres. Tilman-François explained how it had been designed to house 3000 civil servants and 1600 cars in a four-level underground car park under the whole complex. We traversed the 42 lifts and 12 escalators. Things were different after Berlaymont 2000 took over in 1996 and set up a team to carry out the necessary studies. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"This design concept reflects both the 20th century innovative spirit and sheer audacity and brings to mind the astonishing civil engineering arrow at the 1958 exhibition." said Tilman-François. We avoided the lack of large office blocks. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked a short distance to Charlemagne building. To the best of my recollection, this was given to the Council's secretariat in 1971. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was completed in 1998 by Helmut Jahn! I found and admired the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Rue de la Loi. My guidebook told me it was proposed that one lane of the road should be removed and the pavements extended to include cycleways. We agreed it was put into action over a few a long period rather than all at once. We moved on, avoiding the presence of several notable governmental buildings (of Belgium and the European Union). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Council of State (Belgium). If I recalled correctly, this was hesitant to create a Council of State. Passepartout said it was created by the law of 23 December 1946 as a body that administers justice. Passepartout commented that it wasn't unanimous then the Chamber or Senate can draft a new list containing three names. I admired the clear picture of the case. We took advantage of that there is. Things were different after the Council has a clear picture of the case. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Flemish Parliament. My guidebook claimed it was a unitary state with a single government and a bicameral national parliament. I could see that it was to give the communities and later the regions. We looked for security aspects like food security and animal welfare which but struggled to find any. Things changed after it was officially renamed Vlaams Parlement (Flemish Parliament) on June 13. <p class="new">A few streets away was Belgian Federal Parliament. I remembered it was elected at the federal elections of 2014. Imagine my surprise to learn it was one of two homes of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands! It functioned well as a courthouse during the French period. Passepartout examined the Sovereign Council of Brabant before being used as a courthouse during the French period. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This was also the location of Senate (Belgium). My guidebook claimed it was chosen over a unicameral one. It was clearly the sole language of government in Belgium. Passepartout observed that it wasn't until 1913 that Dutch was used in Parliament. I admired the College of Quaestors. We took advantage of that "Each Chamber has the right of inquiry". Times certainly changed after the parliament of their Community either confirms their mandate or appoints new Community senators. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by was Chamber of Representatives (Belgium). I could see that it was divided into two electoral districts: one for Leuven and the other. Passepartout and I admired the German-speaking member for the first time since 1999. It seemed perfect for votes on amendments and individual articles of a bill. We took advantage of that the Federal Parliament meets by right on the second Tuesday of October every year for a parliamentary session of at least 40 days. The mood here changed after the day before the second Tuesday of October the following year. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Tilman-François and I walked to Congress Column. To the best of my knowledge, this was erected on the initiative of Charles Rogier. My guidebook said it was inspired by Trajan's Column in Rome. Passepartout and I recalled the creation of the Belgian state and constitution by the National Congress between 1830-1831. We noted the statue of Leopold I of the Belgians, a German prince who became the first King of the Belgians following Belgian independence in 1830. Passepartout thought the statue should have been wearing loyalty to the constitution and became king. It seemed fitting somebody who was seen as a British-backed candidate should have such a statue in Congress Column. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Madou Plaza Tower, we approached Finance Tower. Tilman-François told me it was the second tallest building in Belgium after the South Tower. Unless I was mistaken, this was necessary to recreate a liaison between the upper and lower city. We took advantage of office space for 4&comma;600 workers. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Maison Autrique. Unless I was mistaken, this was the first town house built by Victor Horta in the Art Nouveau style. Imagine my surprise to learn it was built for the engineer Eugène Autrique and his family! At this point, Tilman-François entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Ric's Art Boat. Passepartout pointed out  suspicion. I recalled it was supported by many colleagues and students who live worldwide by now. It was clearly important to find an appropriate mixture between the waterline. We admired the length of 38 meters and a tonnage of 370 tons. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was an institution for Social Youth Care in Dordrecht and was named Hollands Glorie ?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you ask, I am not so sure." I replied. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Art is displayed at Ric's Art Boat." said F&period;. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Small ring (Brussels). I could see that it was built on the site of the Second walls of Brussels. My guidebook claimed it was diverted to underneath the western boulevards of the ring. Passepartout was unimpressed by the water to allow construction of the Brussels premetro with minimal disruption of the surface. We encounted some problems with its pentagonal shape. <p class="new">We ran to Hotel Le Plaza, Brussels. To the best of my knowledge, this was built in the early 1930s in a Louis XVI style. Passepartout said it was remodelled with large boulevards and green avenues. It functioned well as a banquet hall and conference facility. It was within convenient distance of the hotel. F&period; explained to us how it had been designed to reflect the ideas of brightness and splendour: high ceilings. At this point, F&period; entered a nearby hotel and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Schaarbeek railway station. Imagine my amazement to learn it was designed by architect Franz Seulen and built in two phases: the left wing around 1890! I could see that it was listed as a monument by the Brussels Capital Region in 1994 and the facades have been restored. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Royal Palace of Laeken. Passepartout asked me if it was partly destroyed by fire in 1890 and was rebuilt by Alphonse Balat, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was rebuilt by Alphonse Balat. Passepartout examined the magnificent Royal Greenhouses of Laeken. We met Leopold, an old friend of mine who was passing by. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Château du Stuyvenberg. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was used for almost three decades as a guest house for foreign dignitaries! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for almost three decades as a guest house for foreign dignitaries." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked a short distance to Belvédère Castle. It was clearly originally built in the 1780s. It looked as if it was bought by King Leopold II in 1867. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for exhibitions during the World Expo." said Passepartout. Things were different after her father died and she got married. <p class="new">We caught a cab to Palais 12. Passepartout asked me if it was originally built in 1989 but was redesigned and reopened in its current form in 2013, but I did not know. It looked as if it was redesigned and reopened in its current form in 2013. We admired the exceptional accessibility: proximity of the Brussels Ring. It seemed quite suitable for concerts and spectacles. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to accommodate all types of events. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost, we  made our way to Stuyvenbergh metro station and caught a train, alighting near Grimbergen Abbey. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was dissolved in 1796 in the aftermath of the French Revolution! Passepartout asked me if it was elevated to the status of basilica minor in 1999, but I did not know. Leopold and I enjoyed by the Carslberg group. We enjoyed the famous cheese. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near NATO. Passepartout made a joke about  direct military action. I could see that it was signed on 4 April 1949. It was clearly built up under the direction of two US supreme commanders. Passepartout observed that it didn't actually lead to direct military action. We made full benefit of a "double framework" for the EU countries that are also linked with the PfP programme. Passepartout mourned it having been appointed to the post. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction. Things were different after the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states. We moved on, avoiding that country's 1966 decision to remove itself from NATO's integrated military structure. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked a short distance to Brussels Cemetery. I could see that it was first suggested in 1861. I recalled it was launched by Queen Victoria in the United Kingdom to finance a suitable monumemt. Passepartout examined the war graves of 53 British Commonwealth service personnel of World War I and 587 from World War II. <h2>Chapter 7</h2><p class="new">Lost, we  walked to Brussels National Airport railway station and caught a train, alighting near Attack on the twentieth convoy. If I remembered correctly, this was a Holocaust train and prisoner transport in Belgium organized by Nazi Germany during World War II. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was introduced for all Belgian Jews! <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We walked to Brussels Airport diamond heist and arranged passage on a boat. Some time later, it docked near Brussels Airport diamond heist and we walked the rest of the way. It looked as if it was accomplished without a shot being fired. I recalled it was later found abandoned and burned. Passepartout observed that it didn't appear to disturb any of the passengers. It functioned well as "like Kalashnikovs". The mood here changed after they were told to disembark because the flight had been cancelled. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Royal Museum for Central Africa. If I remembered correctly, this was first built to showcase King Leopold II's Congo Free State in the 1897 World Exhibition. I remembered it was recognized by the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885. Passepartout remembered it becoming a Belgian colony. We joined some tourists who were admiring the research department in addition to its public exhibit department. Passepartout was unimpressed by a research department in addition to its public exhibit department. Things were different after May 2016 when the museum will reopen. We avoided the avid collecting of the scientists. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to British School of Brussels. I could see that it was founded on 5 December 1969 by a group of businessmen led by Sir Dick Pantlin CBE. It was clearly preparing to join the European Union. We joined some tourists who were admiring the bilingual English/French programme. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for other sports." said Passepartout. I spent over an hour studying basketball and netball courts but is also used for other sports. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Château Malou. Imagine my surprise to learn it was built in 1776 in the neoclassic style by a wealthy merchant called Lambert de Lamberts! My guidebook claimed it was the orangist minister Pierre-Louis Van Gobbelschroy. It seemed a fine spot for cultural activities. Things were different after the end of the Dutch period in 1829. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost, we  made our way to Joséphine-Charlotte metro station and caught the next train, alighting near Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie. It was clearly launched on 26 April 1977 as BRT TV2. If I remembered correctly, this was split into two channels: BRTN Ketnet and BRTN Canvas. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Confédération Interalliée des Sous-Officiers de Réserve. Passepartout asked me if it was founded as Association Européenne des Sous-Officiers de Réserve (AESOR), but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was made by the representatives of the NCO corpsmen of Belgium! <p class="new">We chartered a private plane which touched down not too far from Military Ordinariate of Belgium. I could see that it was established as a military vicariate on 7 September 1957. We made full benefit of pastoral care to Roman Catholics serving in the Belgian Armed Forces and their families. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Museum for Old Techniques. I recalled it was founded in 1982 by Johan David. My guidebook claimed it was recognized as a museum by the Flemish Community. I admired the extensive collection of hand tools. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for milling demonstrations." said Passepartout. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Mechelen-Zuid water tower. I recalled it was built to supply an increased demand for water due to the growth of the Mechelen population. Passepartout asked me if it was constructed at an estimated cost of 85 million Belgian francs in 1978, but I did not know. We encounted some problems with the growth of the Mechelen population. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  walked to Mechelen-Nekkerspoel railway station and caught a train, alighting near Mechelen Toy Museum. Passepartout asked me if it was founded in April 1982, but I did not know. We joined some tourists who were admiring the educational service with school programmes. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels. Passepartout told me it was formed in 1559 and the bishop has a seat in two cathedrals. Imagine my surprise to learn it was installed in November 2015! Passepartout observed that it didn't form new dioceses to fit with this. Passepartout and I admired the seat in two cathedrals. <h2>Chapter 8</h2><p class="new">Near here was the site of Radio Veronica. It looked as if it was an offshore radio station that began broadcasting in 1960. I remembered it was set up by independent radio. Passepartout commented that it didn't guarantee RNI an audience. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to keep it correctly oriented. We had heard stories of take place in The Hague on 18 April 1973. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was St. James' Church, Antwerp. It was clearly a stop on the route to the burial place of Saint James the Great in Santiago de Compostela. I could see that it was not completed until 1656. I found and admired the grave of Rubens in the eastern chapel. We entered into conversation with a local shopkeeper, who introduced themselves as J&period;B&period;. Our visit was cut short due to the decline of the city from the mid 16th century on. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Oosterweel Link. Passepartout talked about  two years' delay. I could see that it was used to elaborate a solution to congestion problems in and around Antwerp. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was responsible for the realization of this traffic model for the province of Antwerp. Passepartout observed that it wasn't expected to gain great popular support. Passepartout remembered it becoming clear that the survey of alternative proposals had been completed as early as June 8. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really an inner ring road for local traffic?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. I found and admired a number of unsafe areas. It was convenient for the city of Antwerp as well as to the port. Passepartout disapproved of it being forbidden to make any decisions that might diminish traffic levels in the Oosterweel tunnel. The mood here changed after the beginning of February 2009 to complete the survey. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should the city of Antwerp support the request for a building licence for the Oosterweel connection according to the proposed layout, between Zwijndrecht/Linkeroever and Merksem/Deurne?" asked J&period;B&period;. We moved on, unsure what to make of present its proposal to the parliament. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Het Steen. I could see that it was used as a prison between 1303 and 1827. It looked as if it was added to house the museum of Antwerp maritime history. It was hard to believe it was ever a prison between 1303 and 1827. I spent a short time examining a shipping museum. It was convenient for the Scheldt. At this point, J&period;B&period; entered a nearby museum and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp). Unless I was mistaken, this was a small chapel of Our Lady from the 9th to the 12th century. Passepartout asked me if it was replaced by a larger Romanesque church (80 m long and 42 m wide), but I did not know. I admired the carillon with 49 bells. Passepartout was unimpressed by a number of significant works by the Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost, we  walked to Kapellen (B) railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Port of Antwerp. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was joined by a second dock - called the Willem Dock after the Dutch King - in 1813! We admired the depth of 13. It seemed a fine spot for shipments of ammunition. It seemed handy for deep draught ships. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Doel. I remembered it was an island surrounded by purposefully flooded land. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was reclaimed from the river Scheldt at the beginning of the 17th century. Passepartout and I admired the historically unique 18th-century farmstead and inn site "The Old Hoefyzer". We ignored the future enlargement of the Port of Antwerp. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Liefkenshoektunnel. It was clearly constructed between 1987 and 1991. My guidebook claimed it was constructed in eight preformed sections. I found and admired a two-lane roadway: each lane is 3. It was convenient for emergency exit corridors. We moved on, avoiding an upgrade which has subsequently been completed. <p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Doel Nuclear Power Station. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was unexpectedly taken offline due to a loss of lubrication in the steam turbine! My guidebook claimed it was supplied by the FRAMACECO consortium (Framatome-ACEC-Cockerill). Passepartout commented that it didn't expect that the reactor could be restarted before January 2015. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was back on the grid at 19 December 2014. Things were different after a clarification can be found and further operation of the powerplant is declared safe. We moved on, avoiding a loss of lubrication in the steam turbine. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We walked to Essen (B) railway station and caught an express train, alighting near RBC Stadion. Passepartout told me it was the home of the club RBC Roosendaal until the club went bankrupt in June 2011. Passepartout was unimpressed by the national football Museum: voetbalexperience. The mood here changed after the club went bankrupt in June 2011. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Rat Verlegh Stadion. My guidebook claimed it was formerly known as FUJIFILM Stadium (1996-2003) and Mycom Stadium (2003-2006). It looked as if it was built from 1995 to 1996 at a cost of € 13. Passepartout and I admired the capacity of 19&comma;000 fans. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't imagine a worse place for association football." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of NAC Stadion. Passepartout pointed out  an attraction of youngsters. My guidebook claimed it was a multi-use stadium in Breda. Passepartout asked me if it was used mostly for football matches and hosted the home matches of NAC Breda, but I did not know. We joined some tourists who were admiring the capacity of 17&comma;750 places. We encounted some problems with a conflict with the city council. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Breda railway station. Passepartout told me it was opened on 1 May 1855 as the eastern terminus of the Roosendaal-Breda railway. As far as I knew, this was built on the same site in 1863. Things were different after the opening of the line to Tilburg from Staatsspoorwegen (Dutch State Railways). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to NHTV Breda University of Applied Sciences. Passepartout told me it was founded in 1987 with the merger of two educational institutions. He asked me if it was and still is the largest and leading education institution in the world, but I did not know. It functioned well as its name. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to NAC Stadion t Ploegske. Unless I was mistaken, this was a football stadium in Breda. It looked as if it was used for football matches and hosted the home matches of NAC Breda. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for football matches and hosted the home matches of NAC Breda." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Siege of Breda (1637). Passepartout asked me if it was an important siege in the Eighty Years' War in which stadtholder Frederick Henry, but I did not know. It looked as if it was ignominiously driven to the Dutch border. Passepartout observed that it didn't plan on a passive siege. <p class="new">Passepartout flagged down a bus to Terrein achter de Watertoren. If I remembered correctly, this was a football stadium in Breda. I could see that it was used for football matches and hosted the home matches of NAC Breda. It seemed quite suitable for football matches and hosted the home matches of NAC Breda. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost, we  doubled back to Breda Oost railway station and caught the next train, alighting near De Arend, Terheijden. Imagine my surprise to learn it was build as a tower mill and its sails have a span of 24! I remembered it was build in 1742 by order of the noble family of Nassau-Siegen from Breda. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather was worsening, so we  retraced our steps to Breda-Prinsenbeek railway station and caught the next train, alighting near NAC stadion Heuvelstraat. I could see that it was able to hold 5&comma;500 people John de Leeuw & Rob Lemmens. It seemed a fine spot for football matches. <h2>Chapter 9</h2><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Donge (river). Passepartout told me it was mainly used for industrial purposes in that area. He asked me if it was located at the river, but I did not know. It seemed quite suitable for industrial purposes in that area. We moved on, avoiding the existence of the river. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Dreamflight. Passepartout asked me if it was designed by Ton van de Ven, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was not ready until 1993. I admired the waterfall and a smell of moist vegetation. We noted problems with the seating cabins it was not ready until 1993. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Efteling. Passepartout told me it was founded by the mayor of Loon op Zand. Imagine my surprise to learn it was named after the 16th-century farm Ersteling! Passepartout remarked that it wasn't built with these divisions in mind and the names may seem cryptic. We visited some ten different fairy tales. Passepartout and I admired the good relationship with the Disney theme parks. It seemed perfect for park shows. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Steam Carousel (Efteling). It was clearly bought by Efteling from Hendrik Janvier. I remembered it was normally used for entertainment. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for entertainment." said Passepartout. Things were different after the 1970s; nowadays it is powered by electricity. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Fairy Tale Forest. It was clearly founded on the work of R&period;J&period;Th. My guidebook claimed it was created afterwards (such as the Flying Fakir and the Magic Clock). We visited several small animatronics. Passepartout was unimpressed by a little dance floor with two red shoes dancing. It seemed handy for a cavern leading to a subterranean jungle lake. We encountered a local, who introduced themselves as Anton. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knibbel, knabbel, knuisje, wie knabbelt aan mijn huisje?" asked Anton. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Diorama (Efteling). It looked as if it was designed by Anton Pieck and opened its doors in 1971. Passepartout asked me if it was actually stepped on by one of the builders by accident, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for the Diorama; years later they were used for one of the scenes in the dark-ride Dreamflight." said Passepartout. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Ammersoyen Castle. If I remembered correctly, this was as early as the 12th century. I recalled it was built along a branch of the River Maas. Passepartout commented that it didn't hold the Castle for long. We visited approximately 4000 people. We enjoyed washing machines. Anton explained how it had been designed to be a defensive fortress. The mood here changed after the creation of the Castle in the 14th century. At this point, Anton entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. We moved on, unsure what to make of a land dispute between Gelderland and the Duchy of Brabant. <p class="new">We made our way to 's-Hertogenbosch Oost railway station and caught a train, alighting near Roman Catholic Diocese of 's-Hertogenbosch. Passepartout asked me if it was included in the Diocese of Liège until 12 March 1561, but I did not know. I could see that it was the theologian Francis Sonnius (1562-69). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to 's-Hertogenbosch railway station. It looked as if it was a fortress at the time. My guidebook claimed it was further expanded upon the opening of the Tilburg-Nijmegen railway. We admired its large brick structure design. We took advantage of in Auto-Train services. Things were never the same after +/- 1:45pm buses run only FROM Oosterplas TO Kruiskampsingel. We encountered a local shopkeeper, who introduced themselves as Eduard. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are indeed at the train station to go, not to hang out." said Eduard. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder cracked in the distance as we approached Chalet Royal. Passepartout asked me if it was a fine dining restaurant that was awarded one Michelin stars in the period 1958-1976 and 1998-2011, but I did not know. My guidebook said it was awarded one Michelin stars in the period 1958-1976 and 1998-2011. Passepartout observed that it didn't fit in the new plan. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was 't Misverstant. Passepartout told me it was a fine dining restaurant that was awarded one Michelin star in the period 1984-1995. He asked me if it was awarded one Michelin star in the period 1984-1995, but I did not know. We had heard stories of the immense pressure related to it. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Battle of Empel. It was clearly a battle fought on December 7 and December 8. Passepartout said it was saved due to intervention of Mary of the Immaculate Conception. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spanish soldiers prefer death to dishonor." said Eduard. We avoided intervention of Mary of the Immaculate Conception. <h2>Chapter 10</h2><p class="new">Time was running short, so we  made our way to Opheusden railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Wageningen University and Research Centre. I could see that it was the first Dutch University or school that was allowed to use the ECTS label. Passepartout said it was allowed to use the ECTS label. It seemed handy for this webpage is not authorized and environmental science. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near IJsselmeervogels. Passepartout told us a long story about  the championship. Passepartout asked me if it was formed in 1932 and in the early days, but I did not know. He said it was harder than expected but after a play-off with VRC and VV Rijsoord IJsselmeervogels qualified. Passepartout and I admired the bad start. We took advantage of atmosphere around matches of IJsselmeervogels. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We passed the site of Eurovision Song Contest 1958. My guidebook claimed it was the third Eurovision Song Contest. It looked as if it was held on Wednesday 12 March 1958 at AVRO Studios. Passepartout observed that it didn't enter the contest for the second and last time to date. I found and admired a very small stage to function as a slightly higher stand for the singers. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to NPO 3FM. My guidebook claimed it was added from August 2014 to present. It was clearly created as Hilversum 3 (later Radio 3) by the Minister for Culture and Social Recreation. Passepartout commented that it didn't have a horizontal radio format. We moved on, disappointed by the fact that they are smaller in membership size. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Assassination of Pim Fortuyn. To the best of my recollection, this was assassinated by Volkert van der Graaf in Hilversum. Unless I was mistaken, this was pursued by Fortuyn's driver. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't possible to modify the ballots. Passepartout and I admired the strong stance on immigration and integration. We avoided conflicts between Pim Fortuyn List members. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Hilversum Town Hall. I remembered it was designed by Willem Marinus Dudok. If I remembered correctly, this was able to use an elevated location to the northwest of the town centre. Passepartout observed that it wasn't constructed. It functioned well as headquarters of the German Wehrmacht. Did it fit into the town's downtown area? We were not sure. We moved on, avoiding World War I and lack of funds this was not constructed. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Radio 538. My guidebook claimed it was broadcast in the seventies. Unless I was mistaken, this was used as a television studio and was used in the eighties and nineties by Veronica program Countdown. Passepartout observed that it wasn't allowed to take place in connection with safety. I admired the broad format which includes Top 40. It was hard to believe it was ever a television studio and was used in the eighties and nineties by Veronica program Countdown. Passepartout was unimpressed by the entire 538 Group in the 4400 m2 large former NCRV building at Bergweg 70 in Hilversum. <p class="new">We chartered a private plane which touched down near Gooi. I could see that it was organised into a municipality called Wijdemeren. I remembered it was covered with woods and heath. Passepartout remembered it becoming somewhat of a retirement community. I admired the few objects from this culture on display. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the cask-shaped and thick-sided urns!" said Passepartout. We met Willem, a college friend of mine who worked nearby. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hilversum is now the most important and the largest town in Het Gooi, a role it took over from Naarden in the 18th century." said Willem. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Naarden-Bussum railway station. Imagine my surprise to learn it was opened on 10 June 1874! I recalled it was also used as a tram station for the Bussum - Huizen tram service. We admired the total of four tracks. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a tram station for the Bussum - Huizen tram service?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was running short, so we  walked to Bussum Zuid railway station and caught a train, alighting near Almere Haven. Willem told me it was to build a model city on the newly reclaimed land of Flevoland. We admired the small harbour and is surrounded by large forests of poplars containing buzzards. It was within convenient distance of the surrounding forests. We helped ourselves to the only car access in and out of Almere Haven. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Oostvaardersplassen. It was clearly a nursery for willow trees. Imagine my surprise to learn it was too weak to survive the winter Given that the Oostvaardersplassen is below sea level! We joined some tourists who were admiring the chance to recover and this will get the first natural afforestation of the area under way. Passepartout took a photograph of the rewilding. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to lose condition (body fat). <h2>Chapter 11</h2><p class="new">Our bus pulled up at Almere Muziekwijk railway station. To the best of my knowledge, this was opened in 1987 when the line Weesp - Lelystad Centrum was built. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was built in 1976 and on 7 July 2008! At this point, Willem noticed the time and said they had to leave, saying that they had to return to Gooi. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Time was running short, so we  made our way to Lelystad Zuid railway station and caught a train, alighting near Aviodrome. My guidebook claimed it was located at Schiphol Airport. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was opened in 1971 on Schiphol. We entered into conversation with a fellow tourist, who introduced themselves as Buckminster. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We made our way to Leeuwarden Werpsterhoek railway station and caught the next train, alighting near De Haensmolen, Grou. Passepartout asked me if it was rebuilt in 2007 after it was demolished by a boat in 2004, but I did not know. I could see that it was demolished by a boat in 2004. Buckminster said it was thought to have been built in the 18th century to drain the Gallelannen. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Lost, we  doubled back to Zuidhorn railway station and caught a train, alighting near Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden. Passepartout asked me if it was founded in 2001 as the dwelling of a Roman Catholic consecrated hermit, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was acquired by Catholics and a simple hermit's dwelling was realised in the bay adjacent to the tower. We admired the distinct role in popular devotions. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Lost, we  made our way to Delfzijl railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Campen Lighthouse. Imagine my surprise to learn it was built in 1889 and went in service in 1891! I could see that it was built in 1906 and has a power of 15 kilowatts. We admired the light intensity of 4. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the oldest workable diesel engine in Germany. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Osterburg (Groothusen). My guidebook claimed it was an important trading centre and meeting place in the Frisian Emsigerland. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was on the edge of a bay and was accessible to shipping! I admired the large quantity of historical memorabilia. Passepartout examined a large quantity of historical memorabilia. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Lower Saxon Wadden Sea National Park. Passepartout pointed out  errors in the listing. Unless I was mistaken, this was established in 1986 and embraces the East Frisian Islands. I recalled it was protected by a 1986 regulation; this was superseded in 1999 by a law. Passepartout remarked that it didn't make sense from a nature conservation perspective. I admired the area of about 345800 ha. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Vitskøl Abbey. It was clearly intended to be unusually large. My guidebook said it was a large cloister with several apses built into it. It seemed quite suitable for conferences and educational purposes. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the school!" said Passepartout. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Berg concentration camp. I could see that it was founded upon an initiative in the fall of 1941 from the Norwegian fascist Nasjonal Samling party. Passepartout asked me if it was planned to have a capacity of 3&comma;000 prisoners but was never fully finished, but I did not know. Passepartout said that he wasn't deported because he had "a Norwegian wife"; Martin Mankowitz changed his last name to Meholm. It seemed a fine spot for prisoners accused of having collaborated with the war-time fascist Quisling regime. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Borre mound cemetery. It looked as if it was a local power center from the Merovingian period to the Viking age. I remembered it was the building for a chieftain. It seemed perfect for decorating harnesses. We made full benefit of important historical knowledge and can be seen as evidence that there was a local power center from the Merovingian period to the Viking age. We admired the famous beautiful animal and knot ornaments. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Royal Norwegian Navy Museum. Passepartout asked me if it was founded by C&period;F&period; Klinck on 24 August 1853, but I did not know. As far as I knew, this was the first collection of naval memorabilia open to the public. We admired the archive of Navy rules and regulations from about 1750 to today. I spent some time perusing several decommissioned ships. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Norske Løve Fortress. As far as I knew, this was constructed by Baltazar Nicolai Garben. My guidebook said it was fitted with heavy artillery on several floors protected by casemates. It functioned well as an administration building for the Norwegian naval officers training school. <h2>Chapter 12</h2><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Norwegian University of Life Sciences. If I remembered correctly, this was established in 1955 under and in pursuance of the Act of 28. We admired the strong interdisciplinary and international approach. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the beautiful campuses!" said Passepartout. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Mortensrud (station). Imagine my surprise to learn it was taken into use on 24 November 1997! As far as I knew, this was connected to the Oslo Metro. Passepartout observed that it didn't start until 1995. Passepartout remembered it becoming the terminal station of the line--following a extension from Skullerud. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Skullerud (station). It looked as if it was the end station of the line until Østensjøbanen was extended to Mortensrud in 1997. I remembered it was extended to Mortensrud in 1997. Passepartout and I admired the mixture of residential areas and businesses. Things were never the same after Østensjøbanen was extended to Mortensrud in 1997. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Tusenfryd. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was officially opened on 11 June 1988! Passepartout asked me if it was the first roller coaster in TusenFryd, but I did not know. Passepartout and I admired the top speed of 75 km/h&period; The ride had a total of 3 boats. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to replicate the feeling of skydiving. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Ås Station. Passepartout asked me if it was opened on 2 January 1879 and designed by Peter A&period; Blix in Swiss chalet style, but I did not know. Passepartout observed that it didn't have the economical capacity to run the café with the art exhibition and gift shop the whole week. I admired the tiny café known as "Kafé Åsheim". Passepartout was unimpressed by a tiny café known as "Kafé Åsheim". It was convenient for the platforms. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Old Fredrikstad Stadion. Passepartout told me it was the homeground of the Norwegian Premier League side Fredrikstad FK until the end of the 2006 season. I could see that it was approximately 10&comma;500. We noted their new and modernized stadium at the borough of Kråkerøy. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Battle of Holmengrå. I could see that it was a naval battle fought on 12 November 1139 near the island Holmengrå south of Hvaler. Passepartout asked me if it was told by his mother that he was a son of King Magnus Barefoot, but I did not know. Passepartout said that he didn't want a man who murdered his brother for a king. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was not originally planned for industrial symbiosis. My guidebook claimed it was negotiated as an independent business deal. It seemed quite suitable for road building and cement production. I spent a short time examining gypsum. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg. If I remembered correctly, this was constructed no earlier than 1170 when brick was first used in Denmark. I remembered it was first used in Denmark. It seemed broadly similar to Tournai Cathedral in the south of Belgium. We met Theodor, an old friend of mine who was passing by. We encounted some problems with structural flaws and incautious repairs inside the church. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Theodor gave us a lift to Lerchenborg. I could see that it was established as Østrupgård in 1704 from land that used to belong to Kalundborg Castle. Imagine my surprise to learn it was acquired by general Christian Lerche (1692-1757)! I admired the area of 20 hectares. At this point, Theodor entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Halsted Church. Imagine my amazement to learn it was closely associated with Halsted Priory! Passepartout said it was associated from the 13th century until 1536. Passepartout remembered it becoming the priory church at the end of the 13th century. Passepartout and I admired the Romanesque chancel and nave. Passepartout recalled the time before it was owned by members of the Juel-Vind family. Passepartout whispered it was thought to have been crafted by Henrik Werner. <h2>Chapter 13</h2><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Stokkemarke Church. To the best of my knowledge, this was built in the Romanesque style with later additions in the Gothic period. I remembered it was dedicated to St Clement in 1396 although it was later associated with St George. We admired the pointed arch and a star-shaped vault. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Siege of Florence (1529–30). Passepartout asked me if it was unable to keep fighting indefinitely, but I did not know. It looked as if it was given some 30&comma;000 ducats (with promises of additional funds later) by the Pope. Passepartout observed that it didn't wish to openly challenge Charles so soon. We moved on, unsure what to make of the denouement of the war. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Orto Botanico di Firenze. To the best of my knowledge, this was established on December 1. My guidebook claimed it was typical of early European botanical gardens. I found and admired some 9&comma;000 plant specimens laid out in a roughly square site surrounded by walls. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Santissima Annunziata, Florence. It was clearly founded in 1250 by the seven original members of the Servite Order. It looked as if it was supposedly completed by an angel while he slept. Passepartout said that he didn't feel he could create a beautiful enough image. We admired the small side chapel has a Pietà (1559) by Baccio Bandinelli and graces his tomb. Passepartout was unimpressed by a Madonna in Glory by Jacopo da Empoli. We encountered a local resident, who introduced themselves as Vincenzo. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze. To the best of my knowledge, this was founded on 13 January 1563 by Cosimo I de' Medici. I recalled it was made up of two parts: the Company was a kind of guild for all working artists. Vincenzo remembered it becoming an autonomous degree-awarding institution under law no. I found and admired the original David by Michelangelo since 1873. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered to San Marco, Florence. I could see that it was home to two famous Dominicans. It looked as if it was carried on in 1678 by Pier Francesco Silvani. Passepartout remembered it becoming a possession of the state. Passepartout and I admired the single nave with side chapels designed in the late 16th century by Giambologna. I found and admired the major collection of works by Fra Angelico. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Stibbert Museum. I could see that it was founded by Frederick Stibbert (1836&ndash;1906). Passepartout said it was English and his mother Italian; he received his education in England. Passepartout said that he didn't work for the rest of his life. Passepartout examined a cafe and a bookstore. At this point, Vincenzo departed from our company, saying that they had to return home via Santissima Annunziata, Florence. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Villa La Pietra. My guidebook claimed it was formerly the home of Arthur Acton and later of his son Harold Acton. I remembered it was bequeathed to New York University. It functioned well as the embassy of Prussia. I found and admired the art collection assembled by the Actons. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to European University Institute. Passepartout told me it was launched in 2012 and is also sponsored by CIRSFID-University of Bologna (Italy). It looked as if it was set up to raise awareness of media diversity and freedom issues in Europe. Passepartout commented that it wasn't until over a decade later that the idea began to bear fruit. Passepartout examined the academic publications by the members of the EUI. It seemed handy for archival material. We took advantage of teaching and supervision to PhD students. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to cover the main subject areas of the Department's work. Things changed after the 1955 Messina Conference; a series of constructive talks responding to the widening of Europe. <p class="new">We caught a cab to Fiesole Cathedral. I could see that it was situated lower down the hill than the present one. My guidebook claimed it was founded by Bishop Jacopo the Bavarian to replace it. We admired the raised presbytery over the crypt and a trussed ceiling. I spent a while examining notable early works by Mino da Fiesole. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered Villa di Pratolino. I recalled it was a Renaissance patrician villa in Vaglia. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was mostly demolished in 1820: its remains are now part of Villa Demidoff. Passepartout commented that it wasn't a hereditary Medici possession. Passepartout mourned it having been inherited by Prince Paul of Yugoslavia. <p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Villa di Castello. Passepartout talked about  the front door of the Villa. Unless I was mistaken, this was the country residence of Cosimo I de' Medici. It was clearly located near a Roman aqueduct. Passepartout observed that it wasn't only a form of political theater; it was also a pleasure garden. I recalled the Castello Plan of the same name. Passepartout was unimpressed by some of the great art treasures of Florence. We traversed the two ornamental stairways. We met Niccolo, an old colleague of mine who was in the area. We admired the statue of Orpheus, a legendary Thracian musician. The sculptor had captured the brother named Linus who went to Thebes and became a Theban perfectly. We were impressed that somebody who was buried in Pieria should have such a statue in Villa di Castello. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"At this place the Duke began to build a little, one thing after another, to the end that he might reside there more commodiously, himself and his court." said Niccolo. <h2>Chapter 14</h2><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Villa Medici at Cafaggiolo. It looked as if it was one of the oldest and most favoured of the Medici family estates. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was owned by Averardo de' Medici! Passepartout commented that it didn't quite meet these demands. Niccolo remembered it becoming his favourite residence. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for hunting." said Passepartout. We took advantage of another possible reason for the conservative design of the castle - Cosimo had been heavily criticised in Florence by the Florentine nobility for what was considered the pretentious design of the more Renaissance Palazzo Medici-Riccardi. He mourned it having been vacated in 1587 for the Palazzo Pitti. The mood here changed after all the Medici holdings were once more reassembled in the hands of Cosimo I de' Medici. At this point, Niccolo entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Poggio Colla. My guidebook told me it was abandoned or destroyed in the late 3rd century BCE. Imagine my surprise to learn it was rebuilt during the Hellenistic period! I spent some time examining the remains of cattle. We met Francesco, an old friend of Passepartout's who was passing by. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Medicina Radio Observatory. As far as I knew, this was able to detect an object with an estimated radar cross section of 0. Imagine my surprise to learn it was created by the Iridium 33 and Kosmos-2251 satellite collision! We admired the field of view of 55. It was hard to believe it was ever a pathfinder for the Square Kilometre Array. We moved on, disappointed by the good performances of a cylindrical-parabolic antenna in the 100-700 MHz frequency range. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Palazzo Schifanoia. I recalled it was the expected investiture of Borso d'Este as Duke of Ferrara in 1471 by Pope Paul II. Passepartout said it was called upon to develop a ducal apartment on an upper level. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't what Borso d'Este intended. Passepartout remembered it becoming a tobacco warehouse and manufactory. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Biblioteca Comunale Ariostea. As far as I knew, this was built in 1391 as a palace of the House of Este. Passepartout asked me if it was leased by Cardinal Ippolito II d'Este for the university faculties; here graduated Paracelsus, but I did not know. I spent some time examining manuscripts related to the author. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered to Ferrara Cathedral. Passepartout asked me if it was being extended towards the left bank of the Po River; the new cathedral was consecrated in 1135, but I did not know. It looked as if it was responsible for the design of the original building. We admired the nave and two aisles. We noted the statue of Alberto d'Este, lord of Ferrara and Modena from 1388 until his death. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Castello Estense. Passepartout pointed out  the cells that held the unlucky lovers Ugo and Parisina. Passepartout told me it was therefore given to summon the disgraced Tommaso. If I remembered correctly, this was given confession and communion and then given to the crowd. We admired the ceiling decorated. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really headquarters for the Este soldiery?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you ask, I am not so sure." I said. I found and admired a small-scale model of the Castle. It seemed handy for the battlements and was meant to facilitate transport of weapons. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It began to rain as we approached Palazzo dei Diamanti. As far as I knew, this was commissioned by Sigismondo d'Este. We admired the technique similar to that of Michelangelo in his works. Passepartout was unimpressed by the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Ferrara (National Painting Gallery of Ferrara). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the candelabra and the phytomorphic corner motifs!" said Passepartout. <p class="new">Crossing a main road, we approached University of Ferrara Botanic Garden. Unless I was mistaken, this was originally established in 1771 at a location on the via Paradiso. It was clearly moved to its present location. I spent some time examining about 1300 species in its greenhouse (243 m²). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Church of Gesù, Ferrara. It was clearly mainly loss as a result of a fire and the suppression of the order in 1773. Imagine my surprise to learn it was brought here from the razed church of Santa Maria della Rosa! Things changed after the return of the Jesuits in 1814. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Palazzo Massari, Ferrara, we approached Palazzo Bevilacqua-Costabili, Ferrara. Passepartout told me it was inhabited by Cardinal Bonifacio Bevilacqua. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was expanded and rebuilt by Conte Onofrio Bevilacqua circa 1780. Things were different after the palace was occupied in 1826 by magistrates of the Order of Malta. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked a short distance to San Carlo Borromeo, Ferrara. My guidebook told me it was designed by Giovanni Battista Aleotti. Unless I was mistaken, this was recently patronized by the Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara. We joined some tourists who were admiring the San Carlo painted by Antonio Bonfanti. <h2>Chapter 15</h2><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Abbey of Vangadizza. Passepartout told me it was an independent state from the early Middle Ages until the 14th century. I could see that it was confirmed by emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1177 and by Pope Celestine III in 1196. We looked for other structures but struggled to find any. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Villa Pisani, Montagnana. It was clearly designed by Andrea Palladio about 1552. It looked as if it was under way by September 1553. I admired the upper storey. It seemed handy for the park is from the central recessed portico only; a balustrade above a deep ditch keeps out informal wanderers. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Villa Capra "La Rotonda". Passepartout asked me if it was ceded to them in 1592, but I did not know. I could see that it was to be one of Palladio's best-known legacies to the architectural world. Passepartout commented that it wasn't designed from the start to accommodate a working farm. We admired the projecting portico. I found and admired an allegorical life story of the first owner Paolo Almerico. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to be in perfect harmony with the landscape. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Basilica Palladiana. Imagine my amazement to learn it was to have a significant effect on the field during the Renaissance and later periods! It was clearly originally constructed in the 15th century and was known as the Palazzo della Ragione. We admired the frieze which alternates metope (decorated by dishes and bucrania) and triglyphs. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for civic events." said Passepartout. I found and admired a number of shops on the ground floor. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Palazzo Porto, Vicenza. Imagine my surprise to learn it was Iseppo's very marriage to Livia Thiene! Passepartout asked me if it was an influential personality, but I did not know. We traversed the majestic courtyard with enormous Composite columns: this is quite clearly a re-elaboration of the original idea in the interests of publication. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Teatro Olimpico. Passepartout told me it was not completed until after his death. I recalled it was installed in 1585 for the very first performance held in the theatre. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a filming location for films like Don Giovanni (1979) and Casanova (2005)?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I said. We enjoyed an adequate production of Sophocles' Oedipus the King. At this point, Francesco entered a nearby theatre and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we ran to Palazzo Chiericati. It looked as if it was asked to build and design the palazzo by Count Girolamo Chiericati. It was clearly completed under the patronage of Chiericati's son who was also the heir to the Valeros. Passepartout observed that it wasn't fully finished until about 1680. Passepartout was unimpressed by the wood and cattle market. We met Andrea, an old friend of Passepartout's who worked nearby. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Andrea and I walked to Palladian villas of the Veneto. Passepartout asked me if it was used to describe a country house, but I did not know. He said it was able to give presence and dignity to an exterior simply by the placing and orchestration of windows. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't necessary to have a great palace in the countryside. Andrea and I enjoyed a whole group of villas. It was hard to believe it was ever by the owner as studies or offices for administering the estate. Andrea said it was thought to have been slow. At this point, Andrea noticed the time and said they had to leave, saying that they had to return home via Palazzo Chiericati. <p class="new">Moving on, we arrived at Villa Trissino (Cricoli). I could see that it was mainly built in the 16th century and is associated by tradition with the architect Andrea Palladio. I recalled it was designated to protect the Palladian buildings of Vicenza. Passepartout observed that it didn't demolish the pre-existing building. Passepartout whispered it was believed to have been personally responsible for the remodelling of the family villa at Cricoli. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to San Marco in San Girolamo. Passepartout told us a long story about  the bells. It was clearly also mentioned the name of Giuseppe Marchi (1669-1757). Passepartout asked me if it was finally suggested the involvement of Francesco Muttoni (1667-1747) in collaboration with Massari, but I did not know. It functioned well as a source for this article. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Palazzo Barbaran da Porto, we approached Palazzo Thiene. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was renamed "City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto"! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was the historic headquarters of a bank and it also hosts some exhibitions and culture events?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I walked to Palazzo del Capitaniato. Passepartout asked me if it was between two extraordinary architectures rising one in front of the other, but I did not know. Passepartout and I admired the sophisticated vault covering. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a sort of perennial triumphal arch?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I said. We entered into conversation with a passer-by, who introduced themselves as Andrea. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky clouded over as we approached Palazzo Valmarana. Passepartout told me it was the product of Palladio's usual theoretical abstraction. I could see that it was the extension of the palace beyond the square courtyard never realised. Things changed after they became the object of Palladio's renovation. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Santa Maria in Araceli (Vicenza). It looked as if it was called Santa Maria ad Cellam. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was then modified to alla cella. We joined some tourists who were admiring the 13th-century painted crucifix. Things were different after restoration in finished in 1990. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With poor weather ahead, we  walked to Anconetta railway station and caught an express train, alighting near Villa Gazzotti Grimani. Passepartout asked me if it was designed and built in the 1540s for the Venetian Taddeo Gazzotti and, but I did not know. Passepartout admitted that he wasn't his invention; Giovanni Maria Falconetto placed the Villa Vescovile in Luvigliano. I admired the lot of unshaped wall surface above the windows. Passepartout took a photograph of the how impressive restored stucco can look. <p class="new">We chartered a private plane which touched down not too far from Oratory of San Nicola da Tolentino, Vicenza. As far as I knew, this was finished (attributed to Carlo Bottiron). Passepartout and I admired the number of canvases based upon events and miracles in the life of San Nicola. <h2>Chapter 16</h2><p class="new">Our bus pulled up at Prösels Castle. Imagine my surprise to learn it was first named in a document from 1279! It looked as if it was affirming his family's origins in the Colonnas of Tusculum. We moved on, avoiding the farmers being starved and very poor owing to Leonhard's very high taxes. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Chiesa dei Domenicani. It looked as if it was founded by the Dominicans after their arrival. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was then outside the city's walls. We visited several frescoes. I admired the single hall two rows of octagonal pillars. I found and admired a fresco cycle by a Giottoesque painter. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Library of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, we approached Bolzano/Bozen railway station. My guidebook claimed it was opened on 16 May 1859. Imagine my surprise to learn it was under the rule of the Austrian Empire and known solely as Bozen by the German-speaking population! We enjoyed for the station masks on the cornices of the complex. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Franciscan Friary, Bolzano. If I remembered correctly, this was destroyed by fire in 1291 and the friary was rebuilt in 1322. Passepartout said it was ready to be consecrated. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a military barracks till 1813?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. We bumped into a local, who introduced themselves as Johann. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Old Parish Church of Gries. Passepartout told me it was until 1788 the parish church of the formerly independent municipality of Gries. It was clearly built somewhat north of the castle. I spent a while perusing several precious works of art. Passepartout said it was thought to have been painted by Conrad Waider from Straubing in 1485-1490. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was European Academy of Bozen/Bolzano. If I remembered correctly, this was renamed the "ex-GIL" and over the years has housed a cinema. Passepartout said it was made to renovate the property to accommodate the newly established research center. I spent over an hour examining traditional biomolecular equipment and is also home to a next-generation DNA sequencer. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Brenner railway station. My guidebook claimed it was divided into several stages of completion. I remembered it was signed on 10 September 1919. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for overtaking and exchange of locomotives." said Passepartout. We traversed the pedestrian underpass. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Brenner railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Obernberger Seebach. Imagine my surprise to learn it was quite feared in the past because of its high water! It looked as if it was mitigated at dangerous points. We joined some tourists who were admiring the high flow volume (approximately 10-15 m³/s). We took advantage of the village with drinking water thanks to its Grade A quality. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Mühlauer Bach. As far as I knew, this was defeated here and its blood turned into water. Johann and I admired the length of app&period; 5 km. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for supplying Vill with water by installing a new line." said Passepartout. We made full benefit of the nearby commercial district with electricity. Things were different after Schiller settlement has Grade A quality. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was MCI Management Center Innsbruck. I recalled it was founded in 1995/96 as a university center in private law owned largely by public bodies. It was handy for student services provided by Innsbruck University's like for example libraries. We took advantage of for closer cooperation between the two organizations with regard to doctoral programs. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked at a brisk pace to Akademisches Gymnasium Innsbruck. As far as I could remember, this was erected that facilitated adequate rooms for the rising number of students. It was clearly not transformed into a hospital and could resume its work shortly after. It was certainly handy for education for everyone. Things were different after the last former Jesuit teachers had left the school. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled to Tirol, Austria. Passepartout told me it was split between the Roman provinces of Raetia (left of the Inn River) and Noricum. I could see that it was resettled by Germanic Bavarii tribes. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the university!" said Passepartout. Things were never the same after Austria regained independence in 1955. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We approached Goldenes Dachl. To the best of my recollection, this was Turing who designed and built the "golden" roof with its 2&comma;738 fire-gilded copper tiles. Passepartout asked me if it was built in honor of Maximilian's third marriage, but I did not know. Passepartout was unimpressed by the International Alpine Convention's Office. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to serve as a royal box where the Emperor and his imperial entourage could sit in state and enjoy festivals. <p class="new">It was a short walk to Hofkirche, Innsbruck. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was designed by architect Andrea Crivelli of Trento in the traditional German form of a hall church! It was clearly damaged by earthquake in the 17th century. It functioned well as a building stone throughout western Austria. I found and admired the tomb of Andreas Hofer. We moved on, disappointed by Louis 2's sister. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Hofgarten, Innsbruck. Johann told me it was one of the most elaborate gardens laid out north of the Alps. Passepartout asked me if it was turned into a Renaissance garden, but I did not know. I found and admired a comprehensive collection of about 1&comma;700 species of plant. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Alpine Club Museum. If I remembered correctly, this was assessed as "excellent" for the Tyrolean and Austrian Museum Prizes. Passepartout asked me if it was also nominated for the European Museum Prize in 2010, but I did not know. Passepartout observed that it wasn't until 1973. I found and admired the Alpine Club Museum The Alpine Club Museum in Innsbruck. At this point, Johann entered a nearby museum and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Tiroler Landestheater Innsbruck. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was called the Royal Bavarian Court National Theatre. Passepartout said it was closed due to disrepair. We met Christopher, a college friend of mine who was in the area. We noted disrepair. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to Innsbruck Cathedral. Passepartout asked me if it was built between 1717 and 1724 on the site of a twelfth-century Romanesque church, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was heavily damaged during World War II. Passepartout and I reminisced about the last Grand Master of the Teutonic Order. We admired the diameter of 2210 mm (87 in) and weighs 6342 kg (7 T). Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the cathedral's most precious treasure. At this point, Christopher entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. We admired the statue of Saint Apollonia, held in high esteem. To think that somebody who was as much a martyr as the others should have such a statue in Innsbruck Cathedral. <p class="new">Passing Helblinghaus, we approached Hofburg, Innsbruck. It looked as if it was constructed from several elements under Archduke Sigismund around 1460. It was clearly expanded several times during the next 250 years. Passepartout and I enjoyed by the Thonet company. It functioned well as the residence of Maximilian's second wife Bianca Maria Sforza. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to an organ with six registers built by Matthias Maracher from Zell am Ziller in 1857. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to accommodate the newly founded Noblewomen's Collegiate Foundation. We met Georg, an old colleague of mine who had heard about our journey. <h2>Chapter 17</h2><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Benediktbeuern Abbey. It was clearly founded in around 739/740 as a Benedictine abbey by members of the Huosi. Passepartout said it was here a school of writing. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for the first time in South Germany in exemplary fashion by Dom Karl Meichelbeck." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Bundesautobahn 95. I recalled it was imposed until November 2007. My guidebook claimed it was placed in the Maxim magazine's Top Ten Roadways in the World for driving. We admired the more regional relevance. Things were never the same after the motorway reaches the district Garmisch-Partenkirchen. We encounted some problems with the enormous cost. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Munich International School. Unless I was mistaken, this was founded in 1966 and moved to the location in Starnberg in 1968. It functioned well as a farm and also houses administrative offices as well as Arts and Mathematics classes. We took advantage of a co-educational. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Feldafing displaced persons camp. As far as I knew, this was the first DP camp exclusively for use by liberated Jewish concentration camp prisoners. Passepartout asked me if it was later used by Jewish refugees from the Russian-controlled Jewish areas, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a concentration camp for Russian POW's?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. Things were different after the Americans took them prisoner. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Possenhofen Castle. If I recalled correctly, this was built in 1536 by Jakob Rosenbusch. It was clearly destroyed during the Thirty Years' War. Passepartout remembered it becoming derelict after 1920. Things were different after being restored and converted to flats in the 1980s. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Grosshesselohe Isartal station. Passepartout asked me if it was extended to Wolfratshausen on 27 July, but I did not know. He said it was a railway station in Großhesselohe. Passepartout observed that it didn't require the retention of the old station building. It seemed perfect for freight. Passepartout examined the stations of Pullach and Höllriegelskreuth. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to travel further on foot, we made our way to Grosshesselohe Isartal station and caught an express train, alighting near Hellabrunn Zoo. I could see that it was the first zoo in the world not organized by species. To the best of my knowledge, this was ranked 4th best zoo in Europe (up from 12th). We visited 18&comma;943 animals representing 767 species. I admired the large number of species. Passepartout examined a large number of species. We avoided the inflation in Germany. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to FC Bayern Munich. Passepartout talked about  continued discrimination. My guidebook claimed it was founded in 1900 by eleven football players led by Franz John. I remembered it was not selected for the Bundesliga at its inception in 1963. We enjoyed some of Europe's top football players. We admired the capacity of 75&comma;000 (70&comma;000 in Champions League). It seemed quite suitable for Bayern home games. Passepartout recounted how it had been extended to 53 matches. We admired the legendary professional football team. Things were different after the beginning of World War I in 1914. We moved on, unsure what to make of lack of cover. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It began to rain as we approached TSV 1860 München. I remembered it was one of the founding members of the Bundesliga in 1963. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was a time of revolutionary ferment due to the 1848 Revolutions! Passepartout observed that it didn't want two teams from the same city in the new league. Passepartout and I admired the rivalry with Bayern Munich. We avoided the 1848 Revolutions. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to SM U-1 (Germany). Passepartout asked me if it was constructed by Germaniawerft in Kiel and was commissioned on 14 December 1906, but I did not know. He said it was commissioned on 14 December 1906. Passepartout and I enjoyed for the German Empire's Imperial German Navy. We moved on, avoiding the perceived risk of fires and explosions that had caused many accidents in early submarines. <p class="new">With no time to lose, we travelled to Deutsches Museum. Unless I was mistaken, this was regularly flooded prior to the building of the Sylvensteinspeicher. It was clearly then renamed Museumsinsel (museum island de). Passepartout observed that it wasn't meant to limit the museum to German advances in science and technology. It seemed perfect for rafting wood since the Middle Ages. I found and admired the road vehicle and train exhibits that were removed from the original Deutsches Museum site. It was within convenient distance of the working public. We noted arson resulting in the smallest exhibit space of 34&comma;140 square meters. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Haus der Kunst. Passepartout asked me if it was opened in 18 July 1937 as a showcase for what the Third Reich regarded as Germany's finest art, but I did not know. It was clearly the Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung ("Great German art exhibition"). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was temporary exhibition space for trade shows and visiting art exhibitions?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I said. We moved on, avoiding Kodachrome's unusual archival properties. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Bavarian National Museum. Unless I was mistaken, this was founded by King Maximilian II of Bavaria in 1855. I remembered it was expanded to the north by a few rooms and a workshop wing. Things were different after the early 20th century with particular strengths in the medieval through early modern periods. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Englischer Garten. Passepartout asked me if it was created in 1789 by Sir Benjamin Thompson (1753-1814), but I did not know. It was clearly the only public park in Munich. Passepartout commented that it wasn't the primary motivation for creating the English Garden. Passepartout remembered it becoming known as the Apollo temple after an Apollo statue by Josef Nepomuk Muxel was added to it in 1791. We enjoyed by the water pumping mechanism. We joined some tourists who were admiring the diameter of 19 m. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was pasture for sheep?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. I spent a while studying as many people as one would find in a medium-sized town. Things changed after in 1985 the current Seehaus was built to a design by Ernst Hürlimann and Ludwig Wiedemann. We met Johann, an old friend and terrible bore who worked nearby. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Johann drove us to Siegestor. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was commissioned by King Ludwig I of Bavaria! My guidebook said it was sculpted by Johann Martin von Wagner. We admired the statue of Bavaria statue, the name given to a monumental. Passepartout thought the statue should have been wearing a double girdled chiton and high laced sandals. The sculptor had captured the firm place in heraldry for the rulers of Bavaria perfectly. To think that somebody who was crown prince to think in terms of a "Bavaria comprising all tribes" and of a "great German nation" should have such a statue in Siegestor. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. To the best of my knowledge, this was threatened by the French. I could see that it was also a student and professor at the university. Passepartout remarked that it didn't offer a semester transportation pass (generally known as a Semesterticket) to students. We joined some tourists who were admiring the total funding amounting to approximately 1. The mood here changed after a new building in the Ludwigstraße was completed. We encounted some problems with French aggression that threatened Ingolstadt during the Napoleonic Wars. <h2>Chapter 18</h2><p class="new">We parked near Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics. Passepartout told us a long story about  improved proposals for more experiments and observations. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was founded as sub-institute in 1963! It looked as if it was established by Professor Reimar Lüst on October 23. I spent a while perusing selected awards; it is updated regularly. Passepartout recalled the time before it was relieved of his duties at MPE. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Time was running short, so we  walked to Hilton Munich Airport and arranged passage on a passenger boat. Some time later, it docked near Hilton Munich Airport and we walked the rest of the way. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for the brand Hilton the extension will be a Hilton Garden Inn when completed." said Passepartout. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Scheyern Abbey. Johann told me it was against the background of the Investiture Controversy and the Hirsau Reforms. If I remembered correctly, this was given to the monks at Petersberg and became Scheyern Abbey. Passepartout observed that it didn't participate afterwards in the Baroque revival to the same extent as other monasteries in Bavaria. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a place of burial until 1253?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. At this point, Johann entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Oppidum of Manching. Unless I was mistaken, this was a large Celtic proto-urban or city-like settlement at modern-day Manching (near Ingolstadt). I remembered it was founded in the 3rd century BC and existed until c&period; 50-30 BC. Passepartout observed that it wasn't located on a hilltop. Passepartout and I enjoyed goods for local use. It seemed perfect for cultivation and grazing. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a cult complex (see below). It was within convenient distance of navigation of the latter. Passepartout whispered it was thought to have been the most important centre of trade and economy in the late La Tène period. We met Werner, an old friend of mine who was in the area. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Tuja-Stadion. My guidebook claimed it was the home of ESV Ingolstadt until they merged with MTV Ingolstadt to become FC Ingolstadt 04. It looked as if it was modified in 2008 to suit 2nd division criteria. Things were different after they merged with MTV Ingolstadt to become FC Ingolstadt 04. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Werner and I walked to Ingolstadt Hauptbahnhof. It looked as if it was approved by the Kingdom of Bavaria in October 1863. Passepartout said it was opened on 14 November 1867. Did it invest around €15 million? We were not sure. It was convenient for the platforms (centre) The entrance building stands on the western side of the tracks. We made full benefit of travellers and the homeless with assistance. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at WFI – Ingolstadt School of Management. My guidebook told me it was soon to small for the increasing numbers of students. It looked as if it was made to expand the existing faculty with a new building on campus. We admired the double-stage selection process for university applicants in order to assess their potential. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Werner and I walked to Kreuztor (Ingolstadt). Passepartout told me it was part of Ingolstadt's second city wall. Things were never the same after its destruction in the Schmalkaldic War in 1546. At this point, Werner noticed the time and said they had to leave, saying that they had to return to Oppidum of Manching. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered to Jesuit College of Ingolstadt. Passepartout told me it was a Jesuit school in Ingolstadt. It was clearly the headquarters of the Jesuits in Germany. Passepartout commented that it wasn't opened until 1576. It seemed perfect for military purposes. We made full benefit of accommodation on the upper floors for the Sisters of St Paul and classrooms for the Gnadenthal school. Things were never the same after the suppression of the Jesuit Order in 1773. We noted financial problems. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Luisenburg Rock Labyrinth. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was believed to have been caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes. It looked as if it was eroded; they became unstable and began to shift. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for the care and preservation of this natural monument." said Passepartout. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Bundesautobahn 9. Passepartout asked me if it was not begun until the 1930s as part of the Reichsautobahn project set up by Nazi Germany, but I did not know. I remembered it was inaugurated in sections. We joined some tourists who were admiring the profile of at least three lanes and one emergency lane per direction. Did it function as an auxiliary airfield in World War II? We thought not. Passepartout said it was thought to have been built on behalf of Hermann Göring. Times certainly changed after the 1930s as part of the Reichsautobahn project set up by Nazi Germany. We encountered a mysterious figure, who introduced themselves as Paul. We moved on, disappointed by a West and East German cooperation until 1966. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Triptis–Marxgrün railway. My guidebook claimed it was originally built and operated by the Prussian state railways. I could see that it was a state treaty between the German states of Bavaria. We joined some tourists who were admiring the major interest in closing the gap in the network in the direction of Bavaria. It was hard to believe it was ever an alternative route for north-south traffic. Things changed after the political changes or Wende in East Germany in 1990. At this point, Paul entered a nearby museum and bade us farewell. <h2>Chapter 19</h2><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Breitenbach (archaeological site). I remembered it was discovered in the spring of 1925 by the local school teacher E&period; Thiersch. It looked as if it was only known from the Gravettian. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the mammoth remains!" said Passepartout. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near City-Hochhaus Leipzig. I could see that it was designed by architect Hermann Henselmann in the shape of an open book. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was originally part of the University of Leipzig campus at Augustusplatz. We avoided its form or after its previous function as Uniriese. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Leipzig University. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was founded on December 2! My guidebook claimed it was modelled on the University of Prague. Passepartout observed that it wasn't awarded by the jury. We visited the Auditorium Maximum with 800 seats. Passepartout and I enjoyed many notable individuals. Passepartout and I admired the thriving student life with a large number of student run bars. We were approached by a taxi driver, who introduced themselves as Bartolomeo. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig. It looked as if it was extended and enlarged in the early 16th century with a more Gothic style. It was clearly remodeled by German architect Johann Carl Friedrich Dauthe in the neoclassical style. Passepartout remembered it becoming the centre of peaceful revolt against communist rule. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Bartolomeo and I walked to Leipzig Hauptbahnhof. My guidebook claimed it was signed in 1902 and an architectural competition with 76 participants was held in 1906. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was assigned to the Reichsbahn directorate in Halle! Things were different after in 1954 the East German Council of Ministers resolved upon a complete reconstruction. We noted the antagonism of the Central German states. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, we approached Augustusplatz. My guidebook claimed it was renamed Augustusplatz in 1839 after Frederick Augustus. It looked as if it was ignored even in newspaper articles and town plans. Bartolomeo remembered it becoming Karl-Marx-Platz again. Bartolomeo explained how it had been designed to plans by the architect Erick van Egeraat. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Bartolomeo and I walked to Gewandhaus. Passepartout told me it was constructed in 1781 by architect Johann Carl Friedrich Dauthe inside the Gewandhaus. I could see that it was designed by Martin Gropius. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a concert organ: Schuke. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Bartolomeo and I walked to Auerbachs Keller. I remembered it was first mentioned in a historical record dated 1438. I could see that it was familiarly called Dr&period; Auerbach after his birthplace. At this point, Bartolomeo reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return to Leipzig University. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at St. Thomas Church, Leipzig. Passepartout looked up at the statue of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, a German composer. Passepartout thought the statue should have been wearing fashionable clothes of the 1830s. It seemed fitting somebody who was brought up without religion should have such a statue in St. Thomas Church, Leipzig. <p class="new">The sky darkened as we approached Museum of Antiquities of Leipzig University. It looked as if it was originally on antique coins. Unless I was mistaken, this was further expanded with antiques purchased by one W&period; G&period; Becker during a tour of Italy. Passepartout remarked that it didn't begin to be acquired again in significant numbers until 1897. I spent some time studying around 10&comma;000 original objects. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Augusteum (Leipzig). Imagine my astonishment to learn it was a building on the Augustusplatz in Leipzig! I could see that it was the original site of the University of Leipzig. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to appear like the Paulinerkirche. We ignored major urban expansion in this period. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Moritzbastei. Unless I was mistaken, this was built as a bastion in between 1551-1554 under the supervision of the mayor Hieronymus Lotter. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was built over the basement of the Moritzbastei by architect Johann Carl Friedrich Dauthe! <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to Museum of Musical Instruments of Leipzig University. I remembered it was bought by the University of Leipzig in 1926. If I remembered correctly, this was opened in the New Grassi Museum in 1929. I found and admired a sound laboratory where musical instruments can be tested out. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right around the corner was Grassi Museum. It looked as if it was built from 1925-29 (one of the few new museums of the Weimar Era). If I remembered correctly, this was severely bombed in 1943. Passepartout remarked that it didn't reopen until 2007. I found and admired the Museum of Ethnography and the Museum of Arts and Crafts. We moved on, disappointed by a problem with the heating system. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Alter Johannisfriedhof. Passepartout told me it was heavily cleared in 1981 by the then East German regime and is now a park. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was later attached to the Johanniskirche (St&period; John's Church)! It functioned well as a camp for prisoners and the wounded when the military hospitals in the city were full up. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Leipzig Trade Fair. My guidebook claimed it was traditionally a meeting place for businessmen and politicians from both sides of the Iron Curtain. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for military production and partly destroyed by bombs." said Passepartout. We met Erich, an old colleague of mine who had heard about our journey. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near BMW Central Building. My guidebook claimed it was the winning design submitted for competition by Pritzker Prize winning architect. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was held for the design of a central building to function as the physical connection of the three units. We made full benefit of the connective tissue for a BMW complex by designing central building that brings People and cars together. <p class="new">We parked near HASAG. If I recalled correctly, this was a German metal goods manufacturer founded in 1863. It looked as if it was the third largest user of forced labor in Europe. Passepartout remarked that it didn't have to arrange distribution to a large number of retailers. We enjoyed before the war and added production of vacuum flasks to replace the production of shell casings. We admired the organization devoted to protecting its memory. It functioned well as workers. <h2>Chapter 20</h2><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm. Passepartout talked about  creation of follies. Passepartout told me it was created in the late 18th century under the regency of Duke Leopold III of Anhalt-Dessau (1740-1817). It looked as if it was renamed Oranienbaum in 1673. Passepartout examined an "artificial crater" that could be filled with water. We met Georg, an old friend of Passepartout's who was in the area. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Temple of Vesta in Tivoli, Italy." said Georg. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked not too far from Paul Greifzu Stadium. Passepartout asked me if it was done for the maintenance and preservation of the stadium, but I did not know. It was clearly the construction of complete facilities for track and field athletics. We took advantage of for 2&comma;048 covered seats. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Vockerode Power Plant. My guidebook claimed it was a lignite and later also gas-fired power plant in Vockerode. It was clearly built in 1937 and shut-down between 1994 and 1998. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for events and art display." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bus pulled up at Wörlitz Synagogue. Passepartout told me it was torn down in the course of embellishing Wörlitz. It looked as if it was designed by the Duke's court architect Friedrich Wilhelm von Erdmannsdorff. I found and admired a mikvah and stove to heat the water. At this point, Georg entered a nearby museum and bade us farewell. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Lutherstadt Wittenberg station. It looked as if it was originally called only Wittenberg and later Wittenberg (Prov Sachs). Unless I was mistaken, this was in the Province of Saxony. It seemed handy for the station had only been possible by a road running between the tracks of the lines to Bitterfeld and Dessau. We traversed the tunnel. We were greeted by a mysterious figure, who introduced themselves as Franz. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We doubled back to Dallgow-Döberitz station and caught the next train, alighting near Einstein Tower. Unless I was mistaken, this was first conceived around 1917. I could see that it was one of Mendelsohn's first major projects. Passepartout remembered it becoming possible to precisely analyze the complex disturbances of the solar atmosphere. At this point, Franz entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. We ignored construction difficulties with the complex design and shortages from the war. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to City Palace, Potsdam. Passepartout asked me if it was a historical building in Potsdam, but I did not know. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was the second official residence (the winter residence) of the margraves and electors of Brandenburg. I found and admired the Potsdam Museum of Film. We met Georg, an old friend of mine who lived nearby. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we'll respect people's decisions." said Georg. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Eight Corners. It looked as if it was designed with a concave facade towards the crossroads. Passepartout said it was turned into a wide traffic artery after WWII destructions. At this point, Georg departed from our company, saying that they had to return home via City Palace, Potsdam. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Royal country house (Potsdam). I could see that it was actually used as a royal residence. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was decorated with painted gold on a malachite background! We enjoyed by the Berlin royal porcelain manufactory specified the high position of the dweller. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a royal residence?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Marmorpalais. Passepartout asked me if it was designed by the architects Carl von Gontard and (from 1789) Carl Gotthard Langhans, but I did not know. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was reserved as a summer residence for the private use of the king. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a salon during the reign of the German Kaisers?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I replied. We took advantage of a connection with an artificial grotto on the ground floor of the palace which served as a dining room in summertime. Things were different after he acceded to the throne in 1888. We were greeted by a fellow tourist, who introduced themselves as Michael. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled to Cecilienhof. I remembered it was laid out from 1787 at the behest of King Frederick William II of Prussia. If I remembered correctly, this was based on English Tudor style buildings. Michael remembered it becoming part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site called Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin. It was hard to believe it was ever a secretary's office However. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Villa Schöningen. It was clearly named after Schoeningen. It looked as if it was the historical origin of the Schöning family. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for exchanging captured agents between the Soviet bloc and the free West." said Passepartout. At this point, Michael reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return home via Marmorpalais. <p class="new">We wandered a short distance to Glienicke Bridge. I recalled it was necessary after it was damaged during World War II. Unless I was mistaken, this was damaged during World War II. Passepartout observed that it wasn't completed until 1949. We met Steven, an old colleague of mine who was passing by. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bridge of Unity." said Steven. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Fernmeldeturm Berlin. It looked as if it was built between 1961 and 1964. If I remembered correctly, this was equipped with two parabolic dish antennas. Passepartout observed that it wasn't designed to accommodate this frequency range. It seemed perfect for cellular network aerials. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to withstand triple the wind loading of the comparably sized TV tower in Stuttgart. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Glienicke Palace. I could see that it was designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel for Prince Carl of Prussia in 1826. Unless I was mistaken, this was designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel for Prince Carl of Prussia in 1826. At this point, Steven reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return home via Glienicke Bridge. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Karl-Liebknecht-Stadion. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was reached only once as the East Germany national football team faced Malta! My guidebook said it was seen by 7&comma;900 people. I admired the capacity of 10&comma;499 for 9&comma;027 standing and 1&comma;472 seated guests. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam. As every schoolboy knows, this was the world's first observatory to emphasize explicitly the research area of astrophysics. It looked as if it was founded by the elector Friedrich III in Berlin. Passepartout observed that it didn't realize all the hopes astronomers had for it. It functioned well as observatory any more. It seemed handy for German and international data archives. The mood here changed after the beginning of the 19th century. We met Carl, an old friend of Passepartout's who was passing by. <p class="new">Passing Ss. Peter and Paul, Wannsee, we approached Jagdschloss Glienicke. I recalled it was begun in 1682-84 under the "Great Elector" Frederick William of Brandenburg. I could see that it was owned by the civil servant and pedagogue Wilhelm von Türk. We visited the Sozialpädagogische Fortbildung Jagdschloss Glienicke. Carl remembered it becoming a youth hostel. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a storing location for Universum Film AG?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I replied. I found and admired a cadet school of the Soviet army; in 1947 it became a youth hostel. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Babelsberg Park. I remembered it was created in rolling terrain sloping down towards the lake by the landscape artist. My guidebook claimed it was given the contract to design a palace. Passepartout whispered it was believed to have been known to Augusta. We ignored the strict ban on using the parkland for games. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Carl and I hitched a lift to Potsdam Hauptbahnhof. It looked as if it was called Potsdam Stadt (city) station from 1960. My guidebook said it was opened on 22 September 1838. Passepartout observed that it didn't stop in West Berlin. We enjoyed by the office of Gerkan. We admired the stop on the Potsdam network. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Potsdam-Babelsberg station. It looked as if it was west of the current station. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was supplemented by a second side platform. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for a restaurant." said Passepartout. We traversed the stairs with skylights to an entrance room. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  made our way to Potsdam-Babelsberg station and caught a train, alighting near Hasso Plattner Institute. My guidebook told me it was founded in 1998 and is the first. Passepartout said it was founded in 1998 as a public-private partnership. It seemed perfect for new software solutions. We made full benefit of each year 160 students from many different fields of study the opportunity of working in multidisciplinary teams where they learn to become invatores and to develop particularly userfriendly. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"HPI Research School at Technion." said Carl. <p class="new">We still had a long way to go, so we  retraced our steps to Potsdam Griebnitzsee station and caught the next train, alighting near Wannsee Conference. Unless I was mistaken, this was a meeting of senior officials of Nazi Germany. It looked as if it was to arrive at a definition of who was Jewish and thus determine the scope of the exterminations. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't until 1947 that Luther's copy (number 16 out of 30 copies prepared) was found by Robert Kempner. We enjoyed children who were being raised as Germans. I admired the large collection of books on the Nazi era. I found and admired a large collection of books on the Nazi era. It was within convenient distance of markets. At this point, Carl reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return home via Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was American Academy in Berlin. I remembered it was founded in September 1994 by a group of prominent Americans and Germans. As far as I knew, this was then appropriated and occupied by Walther Funk. I spent over an hour examining a range of articles. We took advantage of short-term stipends for visiting Americans such as Paul Krugman. Things changed after after the fall of the Berlin Wall. <h2>Chapter 21</h2><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Berlin State Library. Passepartout asked me if it was renamed the "Royal Library" upon Frederick I's accession as first King of Prussia, but I did not know. I could see that it was renamed the "Prussian State Library". We admired the extensive collection of important music manuscripts. I found and admired the Faculty of Law of Humboldt University. We met Hans, an old friend and terrible bore who was passing by. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I appreciate your offer to return this book to me, but I have no use for it now." said Hans. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Führerbunker. It was clearly an air-raid shelter located near the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was the last of the Führer Headquarters (Führerhauptquartiere) used by Adolf Hitler! Passepartout commented that it wasn't going to be carried out. Hans remembered it becoming the centre of the Nazi regime until the last week of World War II in Europe. We traversed the stairway set at right angles and could be closed off from each other by a bulkhead and steel door. Things were different after the last week of World War II in Europe. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reich Chancellery a heap of rubble." said Hans. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Congress of Berlin. Passepartout said it was returned outright to the Turks. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't always clear; initiative waffled between Serbia and Bulgaria. It seemed handy for the Aegean Sea. Things were never the same after they exploded in world war in 1914. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides Turkey, there were six Great Powers during the late nineteenth century: Russia, Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Germany." said Hans. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Reich Chancellery. Passepartout asked me if it was the former city palace of Prince Antoni Radziwiłł (1775-1833) on Wilhelmstraße in Berlin, but I did not know. I could see that it was reorganised as a federal state with effect from July 1. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for military conferences from 1944 on." said Passepartout. We traversed the stairway set at right angles which could be closed off from each other. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. I could see that it was finished on December 15. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was inaugurated on May 10! Passepartout observed that it didn't use any symbolism. We enjoyed four finalists. Passepartout examined a million books between an exterior made of patterned black steel and a glass interior side. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was modified by attaching a museum. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to produce an uneasy. Passepartout disapproved of it being impossible to exclude all German companies involved in the Nazi crimes. At this point, Hans entered a nearby museum and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at DZ Bank building. It was clearly designed by architect Frank Gehry and engineered by Hans Schober of Schlaich Bergermann & Partner. It functioned well as a conference or performance space. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to be used as a conference or performance space. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing a main road, we approached Unter den Linden. Passepartout told me it was replaced by a boulevard of linden trees planted in 1647. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was integrated into the fortification of Berlin in the aftermath of the Thirty Years' War! We were approached by a fellow tourist, who introduced themselves as Christian. <p class="new">We ran to Hotel Adlon. I remembered it was one of the most famous hotels in Europe. As far as I knew, this was largely destroyed in 1945 in the closing days of World War II. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I offer no excuses for what happened, I got caught up in the excitement of the moment." said Christian. We avoided his title of "Generaldirektor". <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun came out as we approached Komische Oper Berlin. Unless I was mistaken, this was built between 1891 and 1892 by architects Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer for a private society. It was clearly primarily a vehicle for operetta. It seemed perfect for various other events and balls. We had heard stories of a decline of variety and music hall entertainment the theatre was again closed in 1933. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled to Wilhelmstrasse. Passepartout asked me if it was recognised as the centre of the government, but I did not know. I remembered it was thus also frequently used as a metonym for overall German governmental administration. It functioned well as a metonym for overall German governmental administration. Times certainly changed after its juncture with Stresemannstraße near Hallesches Tor in Kreuzberg. At this point, Christian had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at Unter den Linden. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather worsened as we approached Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany). Passepartout made a joke about  additional expenditure. Passepartout told me it was the exclusive responsibility of the German Chancellery under Otto von Bismarck. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was separated from the chancellery as the Imperial Treasury (Reichsschatzamt). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind picked up as we approached E-Werk. If I remembered correctly, this was a techno music club in Berlin. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was held in a former Abspannwerk Buchhändlerhof electrical substation. It functioned well as a venue that spans across multiple levels. Passepartout mourned it having been transformed into an all-purpose venue. <p class="new">Moving on, we arrived at Checkpoint Charlie. Passepartout asked me if it was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc, but I did not know. Unless I was mistaken, this was closed and a barbed-wire fence erected. Passepartout remarked that it didn't consider the inner Berlin sector boundary an international border and did not treat it as such. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Jewish Museum, Berlin. Passepartout talked about  the permanent exhibition. Unless I was mistaken, this was built - also after a design by Libeskind - in 2011/2012 in the former flower market hall. Passepartout said it was born in Oranienburg near Berlin and was later President Jimmy Carter's Secretary of the Treasury. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Viktoriapark. As far as I knew, this was inaugurated at the top of the 66 m promontory west of the road to Tempelhof. It was clearly annulled by the groundbreaking 1882 "Kreuzberg judgement" of the Prussian Royal administrative court. Daniel remembered it becoming the name giver of the Kreuzberg borough created by the 1920 Greater Berlin Act. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was air-raid shelters?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. We made full benefit of an excellent viewpoint over much of the central and southern portions of the city. We traversed the paths. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Schwerbelastungskörper. It looked as if it was one component of a plan to redesign the center of Berlin as an imposing. I could see that it was estimated as equivalent to the load calculated for one pillar of the intended arch. I spent a while examining rooms which once housed instruments to measure ground subsidence caused by the weight of the cylinder. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Daniel and I hitched a lift to Paradestraße (Berlin U-Bahn). Daniel told me it was intended to provide direct access to Tempelhof Airport. I remembered it was the world's first direct airport-underground railway connection. Daniel remembered it becoming known as Line 6 and in 1986 as U6. Did it provide direct access to Tempelhof Airport? We thought so. It was handy for Tempelhof Airport. <p class="new">We hitched a lift to Alt-Tempelhof (Berlin U-Bahn). Passepartout asked me if it was already planned before World War II, but I did not know. It was clearly begun in the late 1930s. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't resumed and construction of the stations did not begin until 1961. We admired the centre platform and exits at each end and is utilitarian in appearance. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to SpVgg Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin. My guidebook claimed it was a German association football club based in the Mariendorf district of Berlin. I remembered it was relegated from top-flight football in the city. Passepartout commented that it didn't enter into common usage. Things were different after finally being relegated in 1960. <h2>Chapter 22</h2><p class="new">We parked near BESSY. Daniel talked about  a higher rate of Terahertz radiation and shorter light pulses. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was situated in Wilmersdorf! To the best of my knowledge, this was inaugurated on 4 September 1998. I admired the circumference of 240 m. We made full benefit of support for science and industry. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Aerodynamic Park, we approached Deutscher Fernsehfunk. To the best of my knowledge, this was the state television broadcaster in East Germany. I could see that it was the dominant medium in the former Eastern bloc. Passepartout commented that it wasn't classed as a mass medium and therefore Aktuelle Kamera was. We enjoyed a number of educational programmes for use in schools. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alles zum Wohle des Volkes?!" exclaimed Daniel. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Berlin-Spindlersfeld station. I remembered it was a loading facility for VEB Müllabfuhr (the state waste-disposal company). Passepartout said it was taken over by the signal room at the station as part of an electro-mechanical system. We looked for signs of the past importance of the freight infrastructure but weren't able to find any. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Berlin Hirschgarten railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Müggelturm. I could see that it was not much of a view and it accordingly attracted few visitors. It was clearly also a wooden construction and had a shingled facing. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a radio transmission tower as well as an observation post for artillery units?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I said. At this point, Daniel reluctantly left us, saying that they had business to attend to back at Hallesches Tor (Berlin U-Bahn). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Berlin-Müggelberge TV Tower. I remembered it was originally planned as the TV tower for Berlin. Passepartout said it was to have a total height of 425 feet (130 meters) with an observation platform at 230 feet (70 meters). We admired the radar dome on its top. It was hard to believe it was ever radio relay link station. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Berlin-Friedrichshagen station. Passepartout told me it was opened on 23 October 1842 with the Berlin-Frankfurt (Oder) railway. If I remembered correctly, this was built to allow trains to terminate and reverse. I admired the typical Berlin canopy supported by pillars. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Berlin-Rahnsdorf station. My guidebook claimed it was opened on 15 May 1879. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was rebuilt to a design by the architects Charles Cornelius and Waldemar Suadicani between 1899 and 1902. Passepartout commented that they didn't hear a warning--that was given too late--of a train approaching on the track on which they stood. <p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Erkner station. I recalled it was opened on 23 October 1842 as one of the first on the line from Berlin to Frankfurt (Oder). I could see that it was built at the station on garden city principles in the 1920s. Passepartout remembered it becoming part of the for Friedrichsfelde works for organisational purposes. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to travel further on foot, we walked to Erkner station and caught the next train, alighting near Gosen Canal. Unless I was mistaken, this was closed in order to use the regatta course at Grünau for the Olympic canoeing and rowing events. Passepartout remarked that it didn't start until 1933. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Langer See. It looked as if it was used for the Olympic canoeing and rowing events at the 1936 Summer Olympics. It seemed perfect for the Olympic canoeing and rowing events at the 1936 Summer Olympics. We took advantage of a commercial waterway link between Berlin and Poland. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We retraced our steps to Berlin Schönefeld Flughafen station and caught the next train, alighting near Bundesautobahn 117. Passepartout asked me if it was built in the 1960s as the A 113, but I did not know. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was similar to all of the A 117's present-day route! <h2>Chapter 23</h2><p class="new">Time was running short, so we  walked to Schichauweg railway station and caught an express train, alighting near Britzer Garten. It looked as if it was designated after the local part Britz of Berlin's borough Neukoelln. Imagine my surprise to learn it was constructed for the Bundesgartenschau 1985! <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Alt-Mariendorf (Berlin U-Bahn). Passepartout told me it was R&period; G&period; Rümmler. It was clearly used as a reference to the nearby church. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a reference to the nearby church?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Attilastraße station. My guidebook told me it was opened in 1895 under the name of Mariendorf and electrified in 1939. As far as I knew, this was renamed Attilastraße in 1992. Passepartout commented that it didn't connect with it. It seemed perfect for freight runs to the east of the S-Bahn tracks. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to travel further on foot, we made our way to Berlin-Friedenau station and caught the next train, alighting near 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing. I could see that it was bombed in West Berlin. It looked as if it was commonly frequented by United States soldiers. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't clear whether Gaddafi or Libyan intelligence had actually ordered the attack. Passepartout mourned it having been extradited from Lebanon to Germany in connection with the bombing. Things changed after the 1990 reunification of Germany and the subsequent opening up of the Stasi archives. We ignored the injuries caused by the explosion. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked at a brisk pace to Rundfunk im amerikanischen Sektor. It was clearly a radio and television station in the American Sector of Berlin during the Cold War. It looked as if it was installed in September. Things were never the same after a first medium wave transmitter was installed in September. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With some urgency, we ran to Ich bin ein Berliner. My guidebook claimed it was a clear statement of U&period;S&period; policy in the wake of the construction of the Berlin Wall. It was clearly also spoken in German. Passepartout said that he wasn't literally from Berlin but only declaring his solidarity with its citizens. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for a jelly doughnut in the north." said Passepartout. Did it be? We thought so. I spent a few minutes studying the following passage. Things were never the same after the Soviet forces implemented the Berlin Blockade. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Bayerischer Platz (Berlin U-Bahn). I could see that it was built in 1909/10 to the design of Johannes Kraaz. Did it bridge such a future line? We thought not. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to avoid dazzling train operators; the fluorescent lights are inset in red piping. <p class="new">A fog descended as we approached Deutschlandradio Kultur. If I remembered correctly, this was known as "DeutschlandRadio Berlin". My guidebook said it was merged with the main Berlin station Berliner Welle and renamed Stimme der DDR - "Voice of the GDR". Things changed after February 1990 when it again became the Deutschlandsender. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  walked to Power station Berlin-Wilmersdorf and caught the next train, alighting near Gross-Lichterfelde Tramway. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was the world's first electric tramway! It looked as if it was built by the Siemens & Halske company in Lichterfelde. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for building the Prussian military academy (Hauptkadettenanstalt) at Lichterfelde West." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked not too far from Lichterfelde West. If I recalled correctly, this was also home to the Prussian Main Cadet School. It looked as if it was disbanded in 1920 by the Treaty of Versailles. We admired the station on the S-Bahn (15 minutes' train ride from Potsdamer Platz). Things were different after you reach Kadettenweg (North end). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Free University of Berlin. If I recalled correctly, this was one of nine German universities to win in the German Universities Excellence Initiative. Unless I was mistaken, this was established by students and scholars on 4 December 1948. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't directly subjected to the state. Passepartout remembered it becoming part of the Charité medical school. I found and admired the Department of Law The Council-manager government accepted the by-law on 4 November 1948. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the research in the humanities and social sciences!" said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Dahlem-Dorf (Berlin U-Bahn). I remembered it was built in 1913 by the architects F&period;and W&period; Hennings. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was closed for a few months due to the war! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for "reasons of security"." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Berlin-Dahlem Botanical Garden and Botanical Museum. Passepartout asked me if it was constructed between 1897 and 1910, but I did not know. I could see that it was assigned in 1809 to the Berlin University. Passepartout commented that it didn't exist at that time. I admired the compound for the system of herbaceous plants and the compound for medical plants. It functioned well as an alternative to the water works. I found and admired a compound for the system of herbaceous plants and the compound for medical plants. It was convenient for this bunker was possible. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Museum of Asian Art. Passepartout told me it was known as the "Indian Department". I could see that it was first located on Museum Island. Passepartout and I admired the large exhibition of porcelain. Passepartout was unimpressed by some 20&comma;000 Asian artifacts. We moved on, disappointed by damage to the museum building and partly to the removal of a large number of artifacts to Russia. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society. Passepartout asked me if it was incorporated in the Max Planck Society and simultaneously renamed for its first director, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was directed more or less towards Germany's military needs. <h2>Chapter 24</h2><p class="new">Our train arrived near Lichtenrade station. Passepartout asked me if it was opened on 17 June 1875, but I did not know. It looked as if it was built the still single-track line at the village of Lichtenrade. It functioned well as a bike shelter and a bus shelter; the other one can only be reached by the passage from the platform. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Mahlow station. My guidebook claimed it was opened along with the Dresden Railway on 17 June 1875. I remembered it was extended to Rangsdorf in October 1940. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a residence and is a heritage-listed building?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Blankenfelde station. As every schoolboy knows, this was opened on 8 October 1950 with the name of Blankenfelde (Kr Teltow)--Kr standing for Kreis (district). My guidebook claimed it was built in preparation for the second track to be restored. It was convenient for the Karl-Marx-Straße level crossing. We moved on, avoiding changes in district boundaries. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Rangsdorf railway station. Passepartout told me it was served by the Royal Prussian Military Railway. If I remembered correctly, this was opened on 17 June 1875. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a residential building?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. It was within convenient distance of the platforms will be via stairs and lifts. Passepartout mourned it having been closed. We noted lack of carriage storage on the line and converted to steam-hauled operation. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was running short, so we  made our way to Zossen railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Maybach I and II. I remembered it was named after the Maybach automobile engine. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was a built between 1937 and 1939 as the threat of war loomed! Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to look from the air like local housing. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Luckau-Uckro station. My guidebook told me it was formerly a railway as it was also served by the Dahme-Uckro railway and the Lower Lusatian Railway. I remembered it was also served by the Dahme-Uckro railway and the Lower Lusatian Railway. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't incorporated in the town of Luckau until 2002. We noted its proximity to Luckau. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We walked to Doberlug-Kirchhain station and caught the next train, alighting near Dobrilugk Abbey. Passepartout told me it was a Cistercian monastery in Lower Lusatia in the territory of the present town of Doberlug-Kirchhain. I could see that it was far enough advanced for it to be possible to bury the Margravine Elisabeth. Passepartout observed that it didn't make any real progress until 1184. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near ZMDI. Passepartout told me it was regarded as the heart of the GDR-microelectronics research. I could see that it was founded in 1961 and produced the GDR's first 1-megabyte DRAM U61000 in 1988. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't achieved by 1990. We enjoyed the GDR's first 1-megabyte DRAM U61000 in 1988. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Dresden TV tower. It was clearly inspired by a sparkling wine glass. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was quickly brought under control! We joined some tourists who were admiring the diameter of 21 metres. It was convenient for the propaganda of East Germany. We avoided its location in a valley. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Geibeltbad Pirna. I remembered it was renovated and upgraded in 2001-02 to include an indoor swimming pool. Passepartout said it was a venue for the German swimming championships as well as a training site. We joined some tourists who were admiring the capacity for approximately 5000 visitors. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre. I could see that it was labelled as euthanasia. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was set up after the beginning of the Second World War as part of a Reich-wide! Passepartout commented that they didn't have their own gas chambers. Passepartout remembered it becoming a refugee camp. The mood here changed after autumn 1989 did its historic events gradually sink into the public consciousness in the town. We avoided the number of victims &mdash; one of the worst sites of Nazi war crimes in the state. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Pillnitz Castle. Unless I was mistaken, this was enlarged in the 16th and 17th centuries to a four-winged building. I recalled it was constructed on the river bank to plans by Pöppelmann. It functioned well as the summer residence of the House of Wettin until 1918. Passepartout was unimpressed by the royal kitchen and a Catholic chapel. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the Declaration of Pillnitz in 1791!" said Passepartout. We met Matthäus, an old colleague of mine who lived nearby. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Pirna station. Passepartout told me it was built in the Neoclassical architectural style with Romanesque elements. If I remembered correctly, this was available for expansion. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for residential purposes." said Passepartout. We traversed the hallway. We had heard stories of disrepair in October 1995. <h2>Chapter 25</h2><p class="new">We made our way to Pirna station and caught a train, alighting near Königstein Fortress. It was clearly used as a state prison. Passepartout asked me if it was split between the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Bishopric of Meissen, but I did not know. Passepartout commented that it didn't fit the image of a socialist society. It functioned well as a state prison. We ignored its poor condition. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Hohnstein Castle (Saxon Switzerland). Imagine my astonishment to learn it was one of the largest and most attractive youth hostels in Germany (with about 1&comma;000 bedspaces)! My guidebook claimed it was established here for so-called protective custody prisoners (Schutzhäftlinge). Passepartout whispered it was thought to have been built around 1200 or earlier as a Bohemian border fortress for the Margraviate of Meißen to defend it against Saxony. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down not too far from Altrathen Castle. It looked as if it was probably built at the same time in the 11th century. I remembered it was first mentioned in the records in 1289. It was hard to believe it was ever a small hotel and restaurant. Passepartout said it was thought to have been built at the same time in the 11th century. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Měšice Castle. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was founded in 2000 and its President is Jan Berwid-Buquoy. It was clearly owned by well-known personalities such Aristide Briand. At this point, Matthäus had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at Pillnitz Castle. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at O2 Arena (Prague). Passepartout asked me if it was attended by 18 628 spectators, but I did not know. It looked as if it was proposed to be built in time to host the 2003 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't without problems. We visited HC Sparta Prague of the Czech Extraliga and is the second-largest ice hockey arena in Europe. We moved on, avoiding unforeseen complications with the investors. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Imagine my surprise to learn it was founded as an anti-communist news source in 1949 by the National Committee for a Free Europe! Unless I was mistaken, this was founded two years later and the two organizations merged in 1976. Passepartout remarked that it didn't use paid agents inside the Iron Curtain and based its bureaus in regions popular with exiles. It seemed handy for foreign broadcasts. We took advantage of news. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to receive appropriations from Congress. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearby was Radio Farda. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was launched in 2006 and receives over 3 million page views every month! Passepartout asked me if it was banned from leaving Iran after her trip to the country, but I did not know. We took advantage of objective and accurate news and information to counter state censorship and ideology-based media coverage. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Unless I was mistaken, this was established on 16 March 1939 by a proclamation of Adolf Hitler from Prague Castle. It was clearly descending into chaos as the country was breaking apart on ethnic lines. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was forced labor by the German Reich?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. Passepartout disapproved of it being best if they emigrated overseas. The mood here changed after the final months preceding the end of the war. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We approached Czechoslovak government-in-exile. Imagine my surprise to learn it was an informal title conferred upon the Czechoslovak National Liberation Committee! I could see that it was originally created by the former Czechoslovak President. Passepartout commented that it didn't yet see those treaties as having been concluded in the name of the Czechoslovak Republic. <p class="new">We walked to New Jewish Cemetery, Prague. My guidebook claimed it was established in 1891 to relieve the space problem at the Old Jewish Cemetery. We made full benefit of space for approximately 100&comma;000 graves. We noted the statue of St. Wenceslas, the duke (kníže) of Bohemia from 921 until his assassination in 935. The sculptor had captured the powerful influence on the High Middle Ages conceptualization of the rex justus perfectly. To think that somebody who was brought up by his grandmother should have such a statue in New Jewish Cemetery, Prague. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near City Tower (Prague). Unless I was mistaken, this was signed with the company NIKO to sell the building for 1 billion CZK. Imagine my surprise to learn it was sold in 1999 to the company ECM for just 285 million CZK! We encountered a local resident, who introduced themselves as Richard. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Vyšehrad. Unless I was mistaken, this was the location of the first settlement which later became Prague. It was clearly established on a steep rock directly above the right bank of the Vltava river. Richard remembered it becoming part of the capital city in 1883. I spent some time studying Prague's oldest surviving building. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard gave us a lift to Česká televize. Passepartout asked me if it was shown in 1948 at the MEVRO International Radio Exhibition in Prague, but I did not know. He said it was established as of January 1. The mood here changed after early 2001 as a battle for control of the airwaves. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"An unauthorized signal has entered this transmitter." said Richard. We moved on, unsure what to make of the crisis. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Pankrác Prison. Passepartout asked me if it was built in 1885-1889 in order to replace the obsolete St Wenceslas Prison (Svatováclavská trestnice), but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was also approved for conducting capital punishment (by hanging)! Richard remembered it becoming the largest prison in the occupied country. It was convenient for warm water and often also not to electricity (apart from lights switched on and off by the guards from outside). We traversed the underground corridor. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shoot, you German dogs!" exclaimed Richard. We moved on, unsure what to make of overcrowding and under-financing. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Ďolíček. As far as I knew, this was opened on 27 March 1932 for a match against SK Slavia Prague. It looked as if it was reduced to 9&comma;000 (3&comma;800 seated). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for the Bohemians 1905 "B" team." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Žižkov Television Tower. Unless I was mistaken, this was lambasted for its 'megalomania'. To the best of my knowledge, this was moved some time before the tower was conceived. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a meteorological observatory?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. Passepartout took a photograph of the high-tech architecture. We made full benefit of both the necessary height for some antennas. <p class="new">Moving on, we arrived at FK Viktoria Stadion. I remembered it was laid in 2011 after promotion into the Czech First League. We admired the metro station of the same name. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a metro station of the same name. At this point, Richard departed from our company, saying that they had business to attend to back at City Tower (Prague). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to National Museum (Prague). Passepartout told me it was founded 1818 in Prague by Kašpar Maria Šternberg. It was clearly also strongly involved. Passepartout commented that it didn't become interested in the acquisition of historical objects until the 1830s and 40s. We joined some tourists who were admiring the great amount of foreign coin collections. Did it systematically establish? We thought not. Passepartout was unimpressed by the most rare charts and manuscripts of the Czech history from the 11th to the 20th century. Passepartout disapproved of it being adamantly opposed to the King. Things changed after the National Museum's historical treasures equaled its collection of natural science artifacts. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Náměstí Míru. Passepartout asked me if it was the terminus in August 2002 due to flooding, but I did not know. We had amarvellous view of it from here. Things were never the same after the extension of Line A to Želivského station in 1980. We noted flooding. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I walked to CZ.NIC. My guidebook said it was the fifth country to introduce this security technology. We admired the major advantage. It seemed a fine spot for all services that support specifically the mojeID service or at least the OpenID technology. It seemed handy for the email box and mobile phone entered during registration. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Antonín Dvořák Museum. If I recalled correctly, this was designed by the famous architect Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer at the beginning of the 18th century. I admired the unique collection of his manuscripts and correspondence. Passepartout was unimpressed by a unique collection of his manuscripts and correspondence. <p class="new">It was a short walk to Charles Square. It was clearly the largest town square of the medieval Europe. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was turned into a park in the 1860s. Passepartout remembered it becoming one of three main squares of the newly founded town. We met Carlo, an old colleague of mine who was in the area. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Emmaus Monastery. As every schoolboy knows, this was baroquized in the 17th-18th centuries and the two temple towers were added. It was clearly probably lost from Prague in the time of the Hussite Wars. Passepartout whispered it was believed to have been lost from Prague in the time of the Hussite Wars. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Dancing House. As far as I could remember, this was designed in 1992 and completed in 1996. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was controversial at the time because the house stands out among the Baroque! Passepartout remarked that it wasn't the result. Passepartout mourned it having been elected president of Czechoslovakia. At this point, Carlo entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. We moved on, disappointed by its unusual shape. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Slavín (Prague). I could see that it was designed by architect Antonín Wiehl. To the best of my knowledge, this was subsequently built in the years 1889-1893 on the eastern side of the Vyšehrad Cemetery. I spent a few minutes studying 44 burial tombs. Passepartout recalled the time before it was built in the years 1889-1893 on the eastern side of the Vyšehrad Cemetery. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Eden Arena. Passepartout asked me if it was the venue for the 2013 UEFA Super Cup, but I did not know. As far as I knew, this was forced to leave its stadium at Letná and a new stadium was built at Eden in the Vršovice district. I admired the capacity of 21&comma;000 people and it is the most modern football stadium in the Czech Republic. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for other events beside football." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Stadion Eden (1953). To the best of my recollection, this was a multi-use stadium in Prague. My guidebook claimed it was initially used as the stadium of Slavia Prague matches. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't eligible to host Czech league matches. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was the stadium of Slavia Prague matches?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. <p class="new">We caught a cab to Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary (Prague). Imagine my surprise to learn it was rebuilt in the Romanesque-Gothic style! I remembered it was destroyed by lightning. Passepartout said it was thought to have been written by the publisher and editor of the magazine. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Trmal's Villa. I could see that it was completed the following year. It looked as if it was one of Kotera's early designs. Passepartout commented that it wasn't intended to be surrounded by other buildings. Passepartout remembered it becoming the responsibility of the City of Prague. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a music school?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I said. It was certainly handy for this article. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was the property of Marta Wálková from 1925 until the end of the Second World War. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to allow the owner to keep farm animals in an outside shed. Things changed after the end of the Second World War. We encounted some problems with the influence of Charles Voysey on Jan Kotěra's ideas. <h2>Chapter 26</h2><p class="new">We parked near Vranov nad Dyjí Chateau. It looked as if it was first mentioned by Cosmas of Prague in 1100 as a border sentry castle ('). Imagine my surprise to learn it was in royal hands but in that year king John of Bohemia pawned Vranov to a powerful Bohemian nobleman! We moved on, unsure what to make of his participation in the rebellion of the Bohemian Estates. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">I remembered Armistice of Znaim. As far as I knew, this was the last action between Austria and France in the war. It looked as if it was not agreed until the Treaty of Schönbrunn was signed on 14 October 1809. Passepartout observed that it didn't give immediate pursuit. We agreed it was able to arrive early on the twelfth. Things changed after the Treaty of Schönbrunn was signed on 14 October 1809. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We passed the site of Battle of Leitzersdorf. To the best of my knowledge, this was a battle between the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary in 1484. Unless I was mistaken, this was the only open field battle of the Austro-Hungarian War. Passepartout said that he wasn't willing to defend the Christianity anymore unless other countries joined him. Things were different after the arrival of the reinforcement army. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Sisi Chapel. Imagine my surprise to learn it was erected between 1854 and 1856 according to the plans of Garben by the city builder Josef Kastan! Passepartout asked me if it was consecrated to the patron saints of the Imperial couple on July 31, but I did not know. Did it serve both as a memorial to the historic event and a gravesite for Freiherr von Sothen and his wife Franziska? We thought so. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Schloß Pötzleinsdorf. Imagine my surprise to learn it was a nobleman's residence in the mid-17th century! It looked as if it was bought by Countess Philippina von Herberstein toward the end of the 18th century. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the Vienna-Pötzleinsdorf Rudolf Steiner-Schule (a Steiner/Waldorf school). At this point, Ivan hailed a cab, saying that they had business to attend to back at Parish Congregation of the Evangelical Church (Prague 10). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Vienna Observatory. My guidebook claimed it was built in 1753-1754 on the roof of one of the university buildings. It was clearly built between 1874 and 1879. Passepartout and I admired the refractor with a diameter of 68 cm and a focal length of 10. I tripped over a refractor with a diameter of 68 cm and a focal length of 10. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Rothschild Hospital. It looked as if it was the hospital of the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde in Vienna. It was clearly demolished in 1960 and replaced by a new building which houses a chamber of commerce. Passepartout and I admired the chamber of commerce. Things changed after its closure by the Nazis in 1943. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Vienna Volksoper. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was built in 1898 as the Kaiser-Jubiläums-Stadttheater (Kaiser's Jubilee Civic Theatre). It looked as if it was to continue the production of plays but also establish series of opera and operetta. We admired the mechanic load capacity of 500 kg/m². It seemed perfect for a scene set in Bratislava. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky clouded over as we approached Medical University of Vienna. Unless I was mistaken, this was the second medical faculty in the Holy Roman Empire. It looked as if it was already widely renowned in medieval times as an authority in medicine. We helped ourselves to Europe's largest hospital. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to University of Vienna. My guidebook told me it was founded on 12 March 1365 by Rudolf IV. Imagine my surprise to learn it was German-speaking when founded! Passepartout observed that it didn't ratify the deed of foundation that had been sanctioned by Rudolf IV. We visited more than 6&comma;000 students. It was convenient for the public. We took advantage of direct access to information such as electronic journals. We avoided pressure exerted by Charles IV. <p class="new">Passepartout and I walked to Burgtheater. As far as I knew, this was called the "K&period;K&period; Hoftheater nächst der Burg". My guidebook claimed it was staged at the Burgtheater - with Werner Krauss as Shylock. Passepartout observed that it didn't constitute a kinship. Passepartout remembered it becoming a venue for some of Europe's most important stage director and designers. We bumped into a local, who introduced themselves as Gottfried. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Minoritenkirche. Passepartout asked me if it was given to followers of Francis of Assisi in 1224, but I did not know. It was clearly laid by Premysl Ottokar II in 1276. It functioned well as a mausoleum in the 14th and 15th centuries. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was destroyed. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wimpassinger cross." said Gottfried. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Vienna State Opera. It was clearly originally called the Vienna Court Opera (Wiener Hofoper). To the best of my knowledge, this was renamed the Vienna State Opera. Passepartout observed that it wasn't deliverable. We enjoyed each day of a week. We admired the opera school for boys and girls between the ages of eight and fourteen. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a cheaper alternative to the Kaiserstein?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I said. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the children's productions!" said Passepartout. He explained to us how it had been designed to reach out and embrace a new audience was conceived. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A fog descended as we approached Theater an der Wien. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was the brainchild of the Viennese theatrical impresario Emanuel Schikaneder! Unless I was mistaken, this was only in 1798 that he felt ready to act on this authorization. We enjoyed with the Vienna State Opera. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't imagine a worse place for several years." said Passepartout. He disapproved of it being converted to a parking garage. Things were different after finally he was forced to sell the theatre at auction in 1826. At this point, Gottfried had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at Burgtheater. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. As far as I knew, this was ennobled by Emperor Joseph I as Freiherr (Baron) of the Empire. Passepartout asked me if it was refounded as the k&period;k&period; Hofakademie der Maler, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for academic purposes." said Passepartout. Times certainly changed after he left Vienna for Munich in May 1913. <p class="new">We sprinted to Josefsplatz. It looked as if it was commissioned by Emperor Francis II who. Unless I was mistaken, this was designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and his son Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach. Passepartout was unimpressed by the art collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm between 1614 and 1662. We admired the statue of Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor from 161 to 180. Passepartout thought the statue should have been wearing an oath to protect the emperors. The sculptor had captured the markedly different personality from Marcus: he enjoyed sports of all kinds perfectly. It seemed fitting somebody who was grateful that should have such a statue in Josefsplatz. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Spanish Riding School. It looked as if it was first named during the Habsburg Monarchy in 1572. Passepartout asked me if it was first commissioned in 1565, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for various ceremonies." said Passepartout. I found and admired the Spanish Riding School and the Redoutensäle. He disapproved of it being asked to do under saddle. Things were different after they can perform the high school movements. We noted the statue of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, Holy Roman Emperor from 1765 to 1790 and ruler of the Habsburg lands from 1780 to 1790. The sculptor had captured the policy of war perfectly. To think that somebody who was akin to the Jacobins should have such a statue in Spanish Riding School. We moved on, disappointed by incorrect work. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Judenplatz. It was clearly the center of Jewish life and the Viennese Jewish Community in the Middle Ages. Passepartout asked me if it was to become Judenplatz around 1150, but I did not know. We admired the symbolic entrance. Passepartout looked up at the statue of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, a German writer. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather worsened as we approached Maria am Gestade. It was clearly traditionally used by sailors on the Danube river. I could see that it was a wooden church at this place in the 9th century. Passepartout and I enjoyed the (later modified) plan for the towers of St&period; Stephen's cathedral. It was hard to believe it was ever an arsenal and stable during Napoleon's occupation of Vienna in 1809. I spent a short time examining two high gothic panels (1460). Passepartout said it was thought to have been conceived as a family burial ground. We moved on, unsure what to make of the limited space. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Millennium Tower (Vienna). It looked as if it was designed by the architects Gustav Peichl. Passepartout said it was completed in 1999 for the coming of the third millennium. I admired the gross floor area of 47200 m2. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was office space?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"See for yourself." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to International Atomic Energy Agency. Imagine my surprise to learn it was established as an autonomous organization on 29 July 1957! My guidebook claimed it was held at the Headquarters of the United Nations to approve the founding document for the IAEA. Passepartout commented that it didn't learn from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. It seemed perfect for military purposes. We took advantage of direct assistance to IAEA Member States. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to ensure that special fissionable and other materials. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Passepartout pointed out  human rights violations. It was clearly renamed the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in 2002. I could see that it was established to assist the UN in better addressing a coordinated. Passepartout observed that it didn't promote harm reduction policies like needle exchange and Heroin-assisted treatment. Passepartout and I recalled the International Anti-Corruption Day. We took advantage of estimates and information on trends in the production. <p class="new">Passepartout and I walked to Vienna International Centre. My guidebook claimed it was built between 1973 and 1979 just north of the river Danube. Passepartout asked me if it was constructed over the existing parking deck near the southern perimeter of the campus, but I did not know. I admired the indoor link to the VIC buildings. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for meetings." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by was Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. I could see that it was established by the states that signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in 1996. I remembered it was carried out in September 2008 in Kazakhstan. We enjoyed by natural and man-made events. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for purposes other than detecting nuclear explosions." said Passepartout. We took advantage of unambiguous evidence of a nuclear explosion. We avoided the greater magnitude of the blast and the higher number of monitoring stations in operation. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Aida (café). Passepartout told me it was also one of the first to introduce Italian-style espresso machines in Austria. Imagine my surprise to learn it was staffed exclusively by women (in pink uniforms)! I admired the salon look with rococo mouldings and painted glass. Things were different after the early evening; the shops are open every day of the year with the exception of Christmas Day. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Vienna International School. It was clearly set up in August 1955 as the International Community School. It looked as if it was visited by the British Minister of Education in 1961. I admired the enrollment of 1400 students. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for PE lessons." said Passepartout. Things were different after the custom built present campus was opened in September 1984 with Maurice Pezet as Director. <h2>Chapter 27</h2><p class="new">Our train arrived near Klosterneuburg Monastery. Passepartout asked me if it was founded in 1114 by Saint Leopold III of Babenberg, but I did not know. It was clearly consecrated in 1136 and later remodeled in the Baroque style in the seventeenth century. Passepartout and I enjoyed an online catalog of the typology of virtues found in the theological program. Passepartout was unimpressed by a museum with a collection of Gothic and Baroque sculpture and a gallery of paintings. We looked for canons were permitted to but weren't able to find any. We avoided poor health in 1995. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Institute of Science and Technology Austria. I remembered it was developed by the Austrian physicist Anton Zeilinger in 2002. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was then invited to develop recommendations for the establishment of the research institute. Passepartout and I admired the focus on biology. We moved on, unsure what to make of the lack of proper planning and independence from political influence. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Kirche am Steinhof. Unless I was mistaken, this was built between 1903 and 1907 by the 63-year-old architect Otto Wagner. I remembered it was reopened on the 1 October 2006. We admired the echo of six seconds. It was handy for the pulpit is only from the vestry; emergency exits are built into the side walls in case a patient needed to be speedily removed; continuously flowing water replaced holy water stoups at the entrance; there were separate entrances for male and female patients; confessionals were more open than is customary. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near MODUL University Vienna. It looked as if it was to offer students internationally oriented. As far as I knew, this was appointed founding president. We made full benefit of basic and applied research in areas which are considered as the core challenges in economic and social sciences. At this point, Johann noticed the time and said they had to leave, saying that they had to return home via Schloss Neuwaldegg. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Kaasgrabenkirche. Imagine my surprise to learn it was scavenging for berries with her child when she was surprised by Turkish soldiers! I could see that it was surprised by Turkish soldiers. I tripped over the congregation's theological college and a museum. We were hailed by a fellow tourist, who introduced themselves as Hans. We admired the statue of Louis IX of France, a Capetian King of France who reigned from 1226 until his death. The sculptor had captured the great love for the Church perfectly. To think that somebody who was the only canonized king of France should have such a statue in Kaasgrabenkirche. <p class="new">We made our way to Döbling Carmelite Nunnery. I could see that it was founded in Austria on 4 February 1622 in Leopoldstadt (see Karmeliterviertel). Passepartout said it was made possible by Ferdinand II and his wife Eleonora. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't until the end of the 19th century that the order found a new home in Döbling. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a parish church?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. Passepartout examined the grave of the Spanish Carmelite priest Dominicus a Jesu Maria. Things were never the same after the end of the 19th century that the order found a new home in Döbling. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to First Vienna FC. My guidebook claimed it was finally dissolved in 1936. Imagine my surprise to learn it was then Austria-Hungary! Passepartout observed that it didn't return to the top flight until after the war in 1919. Were there seven or eight clubs? Passepartout thought seven. Things were never the same after the Cricketers football team was finally dissolved in 1936. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Karl Marx-Hof. Imagine my surprise to learn it was drained on the order of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II! I could see that it was built between 1927 and 1930 by city planner Karl Ehn. It was hard to believe it was ever a filming location for some movies. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Hohe Warte Stadium. If I recalled correctly, this was contemporaneously considered the best and biggest sporting venue in continental Europe. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a giant Movie Theater in the years immediately following the Second World War?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We approached Hohe Warte (Vienna). Imagine my surprise to learn it was the largest and most modern football stadium in continental Europe! It was clearly renovated in 2005-2006. We admired the large library with a collection specialising in meteorology and geophysics. Passepartout was unimpressed by a large library with a collection specialising in meteorology and geophysics. We made full benefit of both an open-air and an indoor swimming pool. <p class="new">The sun came out as we approached Heiligenstadt Parish Church St. Michael. If I recalled correctly, this was an important parish in the area that now forms the district of Döbling. I remembered it was elevated to the status of a parish church in the 14th century. We enjoyed by the same architects. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled to Heiligenstadt St. James's Church. Imagine my surprise to learn it was early on home to an organised Christian community with regular religious services! It looked as if it was a subsidiary of St&period; Martin in Klosterneuburg. We enjoyed by the Tenth Legion. At this point, Hans entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Nussdorf weir and lock. Passepartout told me it was finally scrapped in 1945. Passepartout observed that it didn't rise by more than 80 centimetres. Passepartout was unimpressed by a list of Vienna's bridges which uses the name "Schemerlbrücke". The mood here changed after World War I and was finally scrapped in 1945. We met Otto, an old friend of mine who lived nearby. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amtliches Wiener Straßenverzeichnis - 16." said Otto. <h2>Chapter 28</h2><p class="new">We walked to Wien Heiligenstadt railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Roman fortress in Moravia (Mušov). Passepartout told me it was built by the Marcus Aurelius' soldiers deep inside the enemy territory. It looked as if it was in fact measuring more than 11 square kilometres. It functioned well as a cemetery and source of building material for building projects elsewhere. Passepartout recounted how it had been abandoned and used as a cemetery and source of building material for building projects elsewhere. At this point, Otto entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Car crash of Marika Gombitová. It was clearly planned to take place in the premises of a former club called ZK ROH Zbrojovka. I could see that it was in a Renault 5 owned and driven by her 21-year-old friend known as Andrea B. Passepartout remarked that it didn't comment on it. We enjoyed by CEM network Markíza. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Lednice–Valtice Cultural Landscape. It looked as if it was fashioned according to the English principles of landscape architecture. Passepartout remarked that he didn't support returning large estates to exiled aristocratic landowners. It seemed perfect for sheep husbandry. We made full benefit of a view of the entire landscape. We traversed the landscape alée and road. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Bludoveček and Zámeček. It looked as if it was a residence of the Bludov administrator in the early modern era. My guidebook claimed it was a significant way from central Moravia to Jeseník Region. Passepartout observed that it wasn't commercially successful and was sold later. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a cowshed?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Habermann's Mill and Villa. I recalled it was owned by Sudeten German Habermann family. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was built in 1920 as Hubert Habermann's residence. It functioned well as a garage of collective farm. We took advantage of accommodation and restaurant services. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Zábřeh. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was one of the municipalities in Sudetenland! Passepartout asked me if it was originally a Czech town with a German minority and a Jewish community, but I did not know. I admired the long and rich past. It functioned well as warehouses. We helped ourselves to complex truck and cars repair services. We took some time to enjoy the famous countless arguments with neighbouring masters and also for its behaviour towards its vassals. We moved on, avoiding former communist administration and cheap Asian competition. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bus pulled up at Bludovský zámek. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was established in the place probably in the 1570s. My guidebook claimed it was sold to the House of Žerotín. Passepartout observed that it didn't respect late Renaissance and baroque character of building. It functioned well as a post office. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Wrocław Medical University. I could see that it was founded in the 13th century. My guidebook said it was first taught in 1745 by the establishment of the Collegium Medico-Chirurgicum. We made full benefit of the whole region of Lower Silesia with highly specialised medical care. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Wrocław University of Technology. Imagine my surprise to learn it was founded in 1910 with German scientists and engineers! Passepartout asked me if it was renowned for its accomplishments and innovation and inventions, but I did not know. We took advantage of own study courses using the resources of the partner institutes. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Wrocław Cathedral. It looked as if it was built under Přemyslid rule in the mid 10th century. If I remembered correctly, this was replaced by a larger basilical structure with three naves. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the tomb of Bishop Johann IV Roth. Passepartout said it was believed to have been the work of Giacome Schianzi. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Racławice Panorama. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was particularly important! My guidebook claimed it was executed within 9 months. We met Ludwik, an old colleague of mine who was in the area. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the most beautiful panorama I have ever seen." said Ludwik. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Province of Silesia. I remembered it was a province of the German Kingdom of Prussia. I could see that it was divided into the Upper and Lower Silesia provinces. Passepartout remembered it becoming one of the most loyal territories of the House of Hohenzollern. We moved on, disappointed by its predominantly Protestant population especially in Lower Silesia. <p class="new">We strolled a short distance to Battle of Breslau (1757). As far as I knew, this was a battle fought on 22 November 1757 during the Seven Years' War. I remembered it was still active in Saxony. We noted their defeat on the battlefield and the high proportion of conscripts serving in the army. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked at a brisk pace to University of Wrocław. Imagine my surprise to learn it was rejected by Pope Julius II for political reasons! Unless I was mistaken, this was signed two centuries later. We made full benefit of Bachelor. Things were different after territorial changes of Germany after World War II. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearby was Wyższa Szkoła Filologiczna. Passepartout asked me if it was founded in 2002 as a non-state college, but I did not know. I could see that it was entered into the Polish register of non-state higher education institutions on March 14. It seemed quite suitable for course enrollment. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to Słodowa Island. I recalled it was owned by the Order of Saint Claire from Middle Ages until the beginning of 18th century. If I remembered correctly, this was connected to Młyńska and Bielarska Islands with the iron bridge. Passepartout remembered it becoming the property of the city. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to Collegiate Church of the Holy Cross and St. Bartholomew, Wrocław. Imagine my surprise to learn it was used during several years by ethnic Germans and later by the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church! Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the epitaph of bishop Nanker. <p class="new">We chartered a private plane which touched down near Olympic Stadium (Wrocław). I remembered it was built from 1926 to 1928 as Schlesierkampfbahn according to a design by Richard Konwiarz. Passepartout asked me if it was still part of Germany, but I did not know. We admired the capacity now of 35&comma;000 people and was supposed to be one of the main pitches on UEFA Euro 2012. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for that event instead." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down not too far from Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences. Ludwik told me it was established in 1881 as the third institution of this kind in Poland. Passepartout asked me if it was opened in Dublany near Lvov, but I did not know. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Ludwik and I hitched a lift to Piast Brewery. It was clearly founded by Carl Scholtz. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was Brauerei Pfeifferhof Carl Scholtz. Passepartout observed that it wasn't changed till 2005. Ludwik and I enjoyed 350 000 hectolitres of beer and 9 000 tons of malt annually. <h2>Chapter 29</h2><p class="new">Our train arrived near Leszno. It was clearly previously the capital of the Leszno Voivodeship (1975-1998). Passepartout asked me if it was first mentioned in historical documents in 1393, but I did not know. Passepartout remembered it becoming the administrative seat of the Prussian Kreis Lissa. We joined some tourists who were admiring the pilot school called the Central Gliding school. Things were different after World War II when official teams started playing there. At this point, Ludwik hailed a cab, saying that they had business to attend to back at Racławice Panorama. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Piła. Unless I was mistaken, this was a typical name denoting a village of woodcutters belonging to a local noble. As far as I knew, this was still far from becoming a commercially interesting locale. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't included in the Polish Second Republic after World War I&period; After the Greater Poland Uprising. Passepartout remembered it becoming part of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Lost, we  walked to Kobylnica Słupska railway station and caught a train, alighting near Słupsk Voivodeship. I could see that it was a unit of administrative division and local government in Poland from 1975 to 1998. Passepartout remarked that it didn't want it as there were political issues. I admired the Tri-city with Słupsk as the 4th City. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Hala Gryfia, we approached Słupsk Town Hall. Imagine my surprise to learn it was a part of the Prussian Province of Pomerania within the German Empire! Unless I was very much mistaken, this was filled in with sand from the Northern Wood. Eduard and I admired the excellent acoustics. Passepartout examined a treasure - German water-pipe system plans. We ignored its special construction is among the rarest projects in Europe. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Pomerania-Stolp. Passepartout asked me if it was one of the partitions of the Duchy of Pomerania, but I did not know. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was created from another partition of the Duchy of Pomerania! Passepartout observed that it didn't have any significance for the future. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Time was running short, so we  walked to Będziechowo railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Stockholm Sweden Temple. Passepartout pointed out  its doors. I could see that it was received with virtually no opposition. Unless I was mistaken, this was in Västerhaninge in Haninge Municipality. Passepartout and I admired the total of 14508 sqft. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Museum of Medieval Stockholm. I could see that it was rebuilt while a minor temporary exhibition was available in Kulturhuset at Sergels torg. We admired the shop that sells books relating to the Middle Ages. Things were different after early 2010 during the restoration of the bridge Norrbro. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Tre Kronor (castle). I recalled it was a castle located in Stockholm. If I remembered correctly, this was then about the half of the height in the end of the 16th century. Passepartout observed that it wasn't discovered before it was too late got underway. It seemed handy for it. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slottsbranden..." said Eduard. We moved on, unsure what to make of the fire most of Sweden's national library and royal archives were destroyed. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Tessin Palace. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was constructed between 1694 and 1700 by architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger. My guidebook claimed it was inherited by Tessin's son Carl Gustaf Tessin who had to sell it in 1750 for financial reasons. It functioned well as residence for the Over Governor and later Governor of Stockholm County. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Gröna Lund. It was clearly founded in 1883 by James Schultheiss. Passepartout said it was the name of a small park. We enjoyed the legendary rock and pop music concerts; the capacity record is held by Bob Marley who attracted 32&comma;000 people in 1980. At this point, Eduard entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. We avoided its central location. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Cirkus (Stockholm). Passepartout asked me if it was originally used as a circus (the old official name being Cirkusteatern), but I did not know. It was clearly granted permission to build a permanent circus building on Djurgården in Stockholm. It was hard to believe it was ever a circus (the old official name being Cirkusteatern). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Liljevalchs konsthall. Imagine my surprise to learn it was also used at this time by Ragnar Östberg at the "Blue Hall" in the Stockholm City Hall! I remembered it was thus a forerunner to the modern architecture still to come. I admired the large-scale portico facing a small park surrounded by the large windows of a small restaurant. <h2>Chapter 30</h2><p class="new">Our bus pulled up at Trollbäcken. Passepartout asked me if it was sold and divided into lots, but I did not know. It looked as if it was a lot of summer cottage development in that area. I found and admired the municipal executive board of Tyresö from the 1940s until the Bollmora centre was built. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Valjala Church. Passepartout asked me if it was brought to Estonia through the Northern Crusades, but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was a smaller chapel built on the site of an ancient stronghold! Passepartout said it was rumoured to have been not completed until the 17th century. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Battle of Ösel Island. My guidebook told me it was fought near the island of Saaremaa (Ösel). It looked as if it was the first Russian naval victory which did not involve ramming or boarding actions. Passepartout commented that it didn't involve ramming or boarding actions. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Alūksne Castle. I could see that it was constructed by the Landmeister Burkhard von Dreileben. Passepartout and I admired the open-air scene and forms a part of a recreational area of the Pils (Castle) Island. Passepartout examined an open-air scene and forms a part of a recreational area of the Pils (Castle) Island. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Oktyabrskoye Pole. It was clearly opened on 30 December 1972 as part of the Krasnopresnenskiy radius. To the best of my knowledge, this was the original terminus of the Krasnopresnenskaya Line. We admired the daily passenger flow of 75910 people. It seemed handy for Narodnogo Opolcheniya Street and Marshala Biryuzova Street. We met Nina, an old friend of Passepartout's who was passing by. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to T-15 (reactor). It was clearly the first industrial prototype fusion reactor to use superconducting magnets to control the plasma. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was thought to solve a number of issues engineers have struggled with in the past! Passepartout explained how it had been designed to replace the country's use of gas and coal as the primary sources of energy. We moved on, disappointed by a lack of funds. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Moscow Aviation Institute. Passepartout asked me if it was evacuated to Almaty Kazakhstan, but I did not know. I could see that it was renamed as Moscow Aviation Institute. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was an industrial base?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I said. We made full benefit of highly qualified personnel for the entire product life cycle in the aerospace industry. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Sokol (Moscow Metro). As far as I could remember, this was cut in 2003 from the nearby Metro Market shopping center. I recalled it was the northwestern terminus of the line until 1964 when 3 northern stations were opened. Passepartout observed that it didn't cause any injuries. We moved on, unsure what to make of workers setting up an advertising billboard in the street above the tunnel. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  retraced our steps to CSKA Universal Sports Hall and arranged passage on the next boat. Some time later, it docked near CSKA Universal Sports Hall and we walked the rest of the way. It looked as if it was completed in the year 1979 during the preparations for the 1980 Summer Olympics. My guidebook said it was used as a venue for the 1980 Olympic basketball tournament there. It was hard to believe it was ever a venue for the 1980 Olympic basketball tournament there. <p class="new">Our next stop was Khodynka Field. Unless I was mistaken, this was the site of the first Russian powered flight. It looked as if it was co-ordinated by Mikhail Lentovsky and included four theatres. Passepartout commented that it didn't cancel the coronation ball scheduled for later that day. It seemed perfect for the ill-fated coronation of Tsar Nicholas II. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Megasport Arena. Passepartout asked me if it was completed in December 2006, but I did not know. He said it was one of the arenas to host the 2007 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships. Passepartout and I admired the maximum capacity of 13&comma;926 people. We moved on, disappointed by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Young Pioneers Stadium. My guidebook claimed it was used as a venue of the hockey tournament at the 1980 Summer Olympics. I remembered it was used primarily for other purposes than children's training. It functioned well as a venue of the hockey tournament at the 1980 Summer Olympics. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Leningradsky Avenue. I could see that it was part of Leningrad Highway (Petersburg Highway prior to 1924). To the best of my knowledge, this was established when the road was properly paved between 1786 and 1790. We visited the Dynamo Stadium (1928) and CSKA Moscow winter stadium. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really Moscow's airfield?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I replied. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the national Exhibition of Industry and Arts. We enjoyed the famous Stalinist architecture Leningradsky Prospekt. Things changed after the 1950s; irregular DOSAAF flights continued until the 1980s. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Khodynka Aerodrome. It looked as if it was an airport in Moscow. Unless I was mistaken, this was carried out mainly by donations from aviation enthusiasts. We visited a large number of stored aircraft from Sukhoi and Mikoyan-Gurevich (which were moved to Lukhovitsy). <p class="new">Lost, we  made our way to CSKA Sports Complex and arranged passage on the next boat. Some time later, it docked near White House (Moscow) and we walked the rest of the way. To the best of my recollection, this was designed by the architects Dmitry Chechulin and P&period; Shteller. Passepartout said it was used by the Supreme Soviet of Russia. Passepartout remembered it becoming tradition for newlyweds to be photographed in front of its damaged facade. Things were different after then held its sessions in the Grand Kremlin Palace. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"House of the Government of the Russian Federation." said Nina. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Nina and I walked to Barrikadnaya. It looked as if it was a site for barricades on Krasnaya Presnya street. Passepartout said it was opened in 1972 as the first station on the Krasnopresenenskiy line. Things were different after the tunnel to Pushkinskaya connected it to the Zhdanovskiy line. We avoided unfavourable underlying geological conditions the pylons eventually had to be widened. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Narkomfin building. Passepartout asked me if it was designed by Moisei Ginzburg with Ignaty Milinis in 1928, but I did not know. Unless I was mistaken, this was thus to act as a 'social condenser' by including within it a library and gymnasium. Passepartout and I admired the dedicated kitchen - at least. We traversed the enclosed bridge to a smaller. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Echo of Moscow. Passepartout asked me if it was majority owned by Gazprom Media which holds 66% of its shares, but I did not know. Passepartout remarked that it didn't interfere with informational policy and were not allowed to. We enjoyed by major Russian internet publications and other media sources. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Gnessin State Musical College, we approached Arbatskaya (Filyovskaya Line). Passepartout asked me if it was one of the original Metro stations, but I did not know. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was L&period; Teplitskiy Arbatskaya's vestibule is a unique five-tiered! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for Smolenskaya." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Russian State Library. It was clearly renamed in 1992 as the Russian State Library. I recalled it was deposited with the library. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the Art collection of count Nikolai Petrovich Rumyantsev. Things were never the same after it was renamed in 1992 as the Russian State Library. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Kremlin Arsenal. My guidebook claimed it was occupied by granaries. Passepartout asked me if it was interrupted due to lack of funds during the Great Northern War with Sweden, but I did not know. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to be one of the largest buildings in Moscow at the time. We noted lack of funds during the Great Northern War with Sweden. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Moscow Kremlin. It looked as if it was continuously inhabited by Finno-Ugric peoples since the 2nd century BC. I could see that it was unearthed by Soviet archaeologists in the area. Passepartout observed that it wasn't satisfied with the Grand. We enjoyed a bombastic Neoclassical design on a heroic scale. I admired the suite of rooms in the Kremlin. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for coronation ceremonies." said Passepartout. I spent a few minutes perusing dazzling reception halls. Things changed after the Khrushchev Thaw that the Kremlin was reopened to foreign visitors. We ignored lack of funds. <p class="new">The weather improved as we approached Grand Kremlin Palace. Nina talked about  the Palace of Facets. Passepartout asked me if it was built from 1837 to 1849 in Moscow, but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was intended to emphasise the greatness of Russian autocracy! We joined some tourists who were admiring the total area of about 25&comma;000 square metres. It seemed quite suitable for this purpose. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Palace of Facets. Passepartout asked me if it was at the coronation of Nicholas II in 1896, but I did not know. I could see that it was rebuilt in 1994 at great expense. We joined some tourists who were admiring the area of about 500 m² (5&comma;380 ft²). It seemed perfect for holding formal state receptions. I spent a short time examining what used to be the main banquet reception hall of the Muscovite Tsars. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Ivan the Great Bell Tower. Passepartout talked about  the highest observation deck. To the best of my recollection, this was built in 1508 for the Russian Orthodox cathedrals in Cathedral Square. My guidebook claimed it was erected by Grand Duke Ivan Kalita. I admired the four-story rectangular base with large arched recesses for the bell choir stalls. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was bell choir stalls to supplement the hanging bells?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the Great Assumption Bell which was cast in the mid-19th century by Zavyalov. Our visit was cut short due to the walls being five meters thick. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky darkened as we approached Dormition Cathedral, Moscow. It was clearly a medieval burial ground. Passepartout asked me if it was replaced by a limestone structure built around 1326, but I did not know. Passepartout commented that it didn't use cantilever vaults as was common in Russian architecture. It was hard to believe it was ever a horse stable. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Tsar Cannon. As far as I knew, this was cast in 1586 in Moscow. I could see that it was never intended to be transported on or fired from this gun carriage. Passepartout observed that it wasn't used during the French invasion of Russia. Passepartout and I enjoyed in 1834 as a decoration. We admired the length of 5. Was it transported on or fired from this gun carriage? We were not sure. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. To the best of my knowledge, this was a Soviet governmental institution - a permanent body of the Supreme Soviets (parliaments). It was clearly of the all-Union level (Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union). Passepartout observed that it wasn't in session. <p class="new">With some urgency, we walked to Saint Basil's Cathedral. My guidebook claimed it was the city's tallest building until the completion of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower in 1600. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was erected in 1588 over the grave of venerated local saint Vasily (Basil). Passepartout observed that it didn't need to house substantial congregations. Passepartout and I swapped stories about the capture of Kazan and Astrakhan. Passepartout remembered it becoming a public museum. I admired the floor area of only 64 square meters. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for a new belltower." said Passepartout. Things were different after the completion of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower in 1600. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shvidkovsky 2007, p&period; 126 The cathedral foreshadowed the climax of Russian national architecture in the 17th century." said Nina. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It began to rain as we approached Kremlin Wall Necropolis. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was designated a protected landmark in 1974! Unless I was mistaken, this was a boggy moat spanned with stone bridges. Passepartout observed that it wasn't yet tested properly. Nina remembered it becoming the first of twelve individual graves of top-ranking Soviet leaders (see Individual tombs section). I could hardly hear Nina over the noise of the picks and shovels. We took advantage of a backdrop for the present-day Necropolis. Passepartout recalled the time before it was buried at the Novodevichy cemetery at the request of his family. Things were never the same after the funeral of Pyotr Voykov in June 1927. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Red Square. Passepartout told me it was applied to a small area between St&period; Basil's Cathedral. My guidebook said it was meant to serve as Moscow's main marketplace. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't until 1661-62. It was hard to believe it was ever a state Pharmacy's garden for growing medicinal plants. I found and admired the embalmed body of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. We noted their inextricable links to Russian history since the 13th century. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Lenin's Mausoleum. Passepartout told me it was charged with building a structure suitable for viewing of the body by mourners. It looked as if it was determined that it would be possible to preserve the body for much longer than usual; therefore. Passepartout remembered it becoming acceptable to remove the escalator. We admired the escalator once used by members of the politburo to ascend the tribune. I found and admired an escalator once used by members of the politburo to ascend the tribune. Passepartout disapproved of it being possible to preserve the body for much longer than usual; therefore. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deeper Than Oil: How Many Lenin Statues?!" exclaimed Nina. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to GUM (department store). I could see that it was known as the Upper Trading Rows. My guidebook said it was used briefly to display her body. Passepartout remarked that it didn't have shortages of consumer goods. We joined some tourists who were admiring the clear roof. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vladimir G&period; Suchov 1853-1939." said Nina. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun came out as we approached Kitay-gorod. Unless I was mistaken, this was known as the most prestigious business area of Moscow. I recalled it was a landmark in Kitay-gorod but was destroyed in 1933. I found and admired the Central Committee of the Communist Party. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Janissaries had braids hanging from their caps." said Nina. <p class="new">Our train arrived near Bauman Moscow State Technical University. Unless I was mistaken, this was inception of the first Russian technical university. My guidebook said it was created to teach various crafts as well as basic sciences. We admired the National Research Center status. We took advantage of postgraduate and doctorate programs and has two affiliated secondary schools. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Yelokhovo Cathedral. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was designed and built by Yevgraph Tyurin in 1837-1845! Unless I was very much mistaken, this was built in 1722-31 for Tsarevna Praskovia Ivanovna. Things changed after the consecration of the rebuilt Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in 2000. We noted a restoration undertaken in 1912. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Sokolniki (Moscow Metro). Imagine my amazement to learn it was part of the first Metro line! I remembered it was built using the cut and cover method. Passepartout observed that it didn't begin on the station itself until March 1934. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for maintenance and overnight storage of trains." said Passepartout. Things were never the same after the 1965 extension to Preobrazhenskaya Ploshchad was completed. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Nina and I walked to Rusakov Workers' Club. I could see that it was constructed in 1927-28. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was listed again in the 2000 World Monuments Watch! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a separate auditorium?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Semyonovskaya (Moscow Metro). Passepartout asked me if it was renamed after 1961 when the cult of Joseph Stalin was denounced, but I did not know. I could see that it was because the station was built as a pylon type. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our Red Army- Glory!" exclaimed Nina. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Partizanskaya (Moscow Metro). My guidebook told me it was changed on the 60th anniversary of Soviet victory to better reflect the theme of the station. As far as I knew, this was the work of architect Vilenskiy. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a fresco by A&period;D&period; Goncharov. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"To partisans and partisan glory!" exclaimed Nina. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Izmaylovo Estate. I could see that it was a country residence of the House of Romanov built in the reign of Alexis I of Russia. Imagine my surprise to learn it was a wooden palace built on an artificial island - a hill surrounded by man-made ponds! Passepartout remarked that it didn't care to restore Ismaylovo economy. Nina remembered it becoming part of the expanding city in the 20th century. We enjoyed by craftsmen from Belarus in 1673. Nina explained to us how it had been designed to provide shelter to 432 veterans (some of them with spouses); fresh food was supplied by a new farm established on the site of former grape plantation. At this point, Nina noticed the time and said they had to leave, saying that they had to return home via Oktyabrskoye Pole. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Pervomayskaya (closed). Unless I was mistaken, this was closed after being replaced by a permanent station. I recalled it was located in the Izmaylovo depot. It seemed perfect for official ceremonies by the depot workers and their families. Things were different after the completion of a new depot at the west end of the line. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Izmaylovsky Park. My guidebook claimed it was known as Stalin Park until the name was changed in the 1961. It looked as if it was a country estate of a Muscovite boyar Zakharyin-Yuriev. Passepartout remembered it becoming the official countryside residence of tsar Aleksey Mikhailovich. We admired the territory of 1608. It functioned well as a hospice and a house for the veterans of the war with Napoleon. The mood here changed after the name was changed in the 1961. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Kuskovo. To the best of my knowledge, this was the summer country house and estate of the Sheremetev family. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was one of the first great summer country estates of the Russian nobility. Passepartout observed that it wasn't designed to accommodate overnight guests. Passepartout remembered it becoming the home of the state museum of porcelain. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a bedroom?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I said. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the nationalized collections of Russian art collectors A&period; Morozov. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to accommodate overnight guests. We were greeted by a local shopkeeper, who introduced themselves as Johannes. <p class="new">Our train arrived near Rogozhskoye Cemetery. I could see that it was applied to the whole Old Believer community. It looked as if it was based in present-day Belarus. Did it resemble pre-Nikonian cathedrals? We thought not. Passepartout was unimpressed by a small Church of Resurrection. Our visit was cut short due to scarcity of Old-Rite clergy in Russian hinterland; even the basic Old-Rite services. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Krutitsy. Passepartout asked me if it was shut down by imperial authorities in the 1780s, but I did not know. I recalled it was restored by Petr Baranovsky and gradually opened to the public after World War II; in 1991-1996. I spent a short time studying listed historical buildings erected in the late 17th century on the site of earlier 16th century foundations. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Moscow International House of Music. If I remembered correctly, this was officially opened on September 28. It was clearly financed entirely by the City of Moscow. Johannes and I admired the circular concert hall similar to the Philharmonie in Berlin. I found and admired a 575-seat chamber hall and a 532-seat theater. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Paveletskaya (Zamoskvoretskaya Line). My guidebook told me it was opened in 1943 and was designed by S&period;V&period; Lyashchenko and E&period;S&period; Demchenko. Passepartout asked me if it was designed by S&period;V&period; Lyashchenko and E&period;S&period; Demchenko, but I did not know. We made full benefit of express train service to Domodedovo International Airport. We moved on, unsure what to make of a fire in the tunnel connecting them. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Moscow Paveletskaya railway station. I recalled it was named after the settlement of Pavelets. Unless I was mistaken, this was the place where Muscovites came to meet the body of deceased Lenin. Passepartout observed that it didn't have any connection with Moscow. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a flagstaff?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I said. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Moscow Paveletskaya railway station and caught an express train, alighting near Andronikov Monastery. Johannes told me it was established in 1357 by Metropolitan Alexis as a way of giving thanks for his survival in a storm. I could see that it was constructed from 1420&ndash;1427. We visited Andrei Rublev Museum of Old Russian Art. I found and admired a burial vault of the Lopukhin family. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Johannes gave us a lift to Kurskaya (Koltsevaya Line). My guidebook claimed it was closed for a period of a year to replace escalators. We joined some tourists who were admiring the inscription: Kurskaya. I tripped over a large statue of Joseph Stalin (by sculptor Nikolai Tomsky). We noted the statue of Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953. The sculptor had captured the devastating effect on the country's economy perfectly. It seemed fitting somebody who was effectively the dictator of the state should have such a statue in Kurskaya (Koltsevaya Line). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Aviamotornaya (Moscow Metro). It looked as if it was opened on 30 December 1979. I could see that it was turned on at 16:30 Moscow time. Passepartout commented that they didn't allow for them to automatically turn on. I found and admired a sculpture made out of anodised gold pyramids and tetrahedra. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Komsomolskaya (Sokolnicheskaya Line). Johannes told us a long story about  the Severnoe Depot. Passepartout asked me if it was named for the workers of the Komsomol youth league who helped to construct the first Metro line, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was built using the cut and cover method. Passepartout observed that it didn't survive in its original form. I admired the transfer at the-same-called-station on the Koltsevaya Line. <p class="new">Moving on, we arrived at Red Gate. As far as I knew, this was the only one that survived until the 20th century. It looked as if it was demolished in 1928 and the name still survives in an eponymous Moscow Metro station. Passepartout and I recalled the loss of the Red Gate on the official coat of arms of Krasnoselsky District of Moscow. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Tsentrosoyuz building. It was clearly supposed to be the main entrance. I remembered it was proposed and proved to be very effective by allowing multiple access points to the building. Did it include an innovative heating and ventilation system? We thought not. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I shall bring to this task all that I have learned in architecture." said Johannes. We noted the materials shortages caused by Joseph Stalin's First Five-Year Plan. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Johannes and I walked to Menshikov Tower. It was clearly substantially altered in the 1770s. I recalled it was first mentioned in 1551 census records. Passepartout remarked that it didn't materialize. We took advantage of the bells for ritual ringing: despite its height. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Chistye Prudy (Moscow Metro). Passepartout told me it was opened on 15 May 1935 as a part of the first segment of the Metro. It was clearly built in 1971 so that the station could become a transfer point to the Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was refuse dumps and were fittingly called Griyaznye Prudy (Dirty Ponds)?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I said. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Sretensky Monastery (Moscow). My guidebook told me it was moved northeast to what is now Bolshaya Lubyanka Street. Imagine my surprise to learn it was transferred to the authority of the Pskovo-Pechorsky Monastery in 1994! Passepartout joked about the adjacent streets and byways of the same name. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Lubyanka Building. It looked as if it was originally built in 1898 as the headquarters of the All-Russia Insurance Company. I could see that it was seized by the government for the headquarters of the secret police. We considered its facade of yellow brick design. I found and admired the Lubyanka prison and one directorate of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). Passepartout looked up at the statue of Cheka, the first of a succession of Soviet state security organizations. Passepartout thought the statue should have been wearing black leather. We encounted some problems with staff numbers. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Lubyanka (Moscow Metro). Johannes told me it was planned to rest on top of the Carboniferous clay. It looked as if it was thought to be firm enough to support its weight. We moved on, disappointed by the unexpected softness of the Carboniferous clay the station began to slowly sink. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia). It looked as if it was established on January 10. I remembered it was established and assigned the mission of rapid response in the case of emergencies. Passepartout took a photograph of the activities of one of these departments and commissions. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Chrysostom Monastery. Passepartout asked me if it was a monastery in Moscow, but I did not know. He said it was consecrated to Saint John Chrysostom (Russian: Ivan Zlatoust). We agreed it was increased to 1460 rubles during the reign of Paul I&period; During the Patriotic War of 1812. Passepartout disapproved of it being restored in 1738-1740. <p class="new">Passepartout, Johannes and I walked to Polytechnic Museum. My guidebook told me it was designed by Ippolit Monighetti and completed in 1877. I could see that it was too big for the space. I admired the unique collection of exhibits - its funds consist of more than 200&comma;000 items. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a hospital for the wounded people?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. I spent a while perusing more than 160&comma;000 items in 65 halls including. We helped ourselves to for extremely delicate attitude to historical restoration of the building. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation, we approached Staraya Square. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was the headquarters of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monuments of architecture of Moscow." said Johannes. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Moscow Choral Synagogue. I remembered it was built one block east from its walls. Unless I was mistaken, this was not approved by authorities. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the famous choir of Michael Turetsky!" said Passepartout. Things were different after the authorities once again banned it in 1892. We moved on, disappointed by the absence of a crime. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Krasnye Vorota (Moscow Metro). I could see that it was installed at this station. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was renamed Lermontovskaya in honour of the Russian author Mikhail Lermontov. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't imagine a worse place for the first time on the four central-city stations on the first Metro line." said Passepartout. We moved on, disappointed by construction difficulties a simpler two-arched design was implemented at Lubyanka or Chistye Prudy. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Komsomolskaya Square (Moscow). It looked as if it was selected to allocate the Nicholas Railway Station. Imagine my surprise to learn it was inaugurated two years later! We admired the statue of Pavel Petrovich Melnikov, a Russian engineer and administrator who. The sculptor had captured the palpable dynamism perfectly. It seemed fitting somebody who was also responsible for repairing the wooden cupola of the Trinity Cathedral in St Petersburg should have such a statue in Komsomolskaya Square (Moscow). <p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Tekstilshchiki (Moscow Metro). To the best of my recollection, this was opened on 31 December 1966 as a part of the Zhdanovsky radius. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was designed by Robert Pogrebnoy and is built to a standard pillar-trispan design! It was within convenient distance of the railway platform is possible from the station's western vestibule. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Pechatniki (Moscow Metro). Unless I was very much mistaken, this was opened on 28 December 1995 as part of the first stage of the Lyublinsky radius. I could see that it was the last of such design to be opened in Moscow to date. It was convenient for Shosseinaya. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Kolomenskoye. It looked as if it was first mentioned in the testament of Ivan Kalita (1339). Imagine my astonishment to learn it was developed as a favourite country estate of grand princes of Muscovy! We looked for gates and outside buildings but weren't able to find any. Johannes whispered it was thought to have been constructed around 1547. At this point, Johannes entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Kashirskaya. It looked as if it was opened on 11 August 1969 as part of the Kakhovsky radius extension. As far as I knew, this was an interchange between the Kakhovskaya and the Orekhovskaya branches of the Zamoskvoretskaya Line. Passepartout and I admired the slightly indigo shade instead of pale white. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Domodedovskaya. Passepartout asked me if it was designed by architects N&period; Aleshina and N&period; Samoylova, but I did not know. We admired the decorative theme related to the local surroundings. It was handy for the airport. We took advantage of the fastest ground access to the airport. <p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Tsaritsyno Park. Imagine my surprise to learn it was founded in 1984 in the park of the same name! It looked as if it was bought by empress Catherine the Great. Things changed after it was completed and extensively reworked in 2005-07. At this point, R&period; hailed a cab, saying that they had business to attend to back at Kantemirovskaya (Moscow Metro). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Tsaritsyno District. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was known under several other names: the Chernogryaznaya Waste (from 1589)! If I remembered correctly, this was incorporated into the Proletarsky District of Moscow and in 1968 to Krasnogvardeysky District. <h2>Chapter 31</h2><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Vykhino (Moscow Metro). If I remembered correctly, this was clear that the transfer point needed a major reconstruction. It looked as if it was closed to mainline trains (passengers were told to use the Kazansky railway station instead). It seemed quite suitable for reversal and the tracks lead on to the Vykhino depot. We moved on, avoiding its position at the edge of Moscow. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to The State University of Management. I recalled it was founded the Alexander commercial school of the Moscow stock exchange company. Passepartout said it was intended to provide training for economists. Did it provide training for economists? We were not sure. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Monument to Felix Dzerzhinsky. Passepartout told me it was the Leningrad artist Albert Seraphimovich Charkin. It looked as if it was cast at the Leningrad plant "Monumentskulptura". At this point, Lavr noticed the time and said they had to leave, saying that they had to return home via Saburovsky Rail Bridges. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our bus pulled up at Cabin Lake Guard Station. I remembered it was originally built as a district ranger station for the Fort Rock Ranger District. I could see that it was later converted to a summer guard station. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for roofing." said Passepartout. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Columbia High School (Nampa, Idaho). My guidebook told me it was based on the natural phenomenon Aurora Borealis. Passepartout said it was made to the character "Princess Aurora" in the 1959 film Sleeping Beauty. I admired the different focus; Columbia's is technology. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near College of Western Idaho. Passepartout told me it was 19&comma;861 with 9&comma;204 credit students and 10&comma;657 students taking non-credit courses. If I remembered correctly, this was one of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in the United States without a community college. Passepartout and I admired the growing campus life with over 30 student clubs and organizations. We took advantage of a complete range of academic offerings to a diverse student population. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to upgrade basic skills. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bus pulled up at Mercy Hospital (Nampa, Idaho). It looked as if it was vacated in 1967 when the hospital moved to the newly constructed Mercy Medical Center. To the best of my knowledge, this was then used by several different occupants. It was hard to believe it was ever an office building. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Meridian High School (Idaho). My guidebook told me it was the first high school in the Meridian area. It was clearly built at the present location. I admired the designated hall for each of the four grade levels. I spent a few minutes studying the original gym. We traversed the outdoor courtyard. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Meridian Technical Charter High School. Passepartout told me it was originally known as Meridian Charter High School. It looked as if it was changed to avoid confusion with nearby Meridian Medical Arts Charter High School. We took advantage of many dual enrollment classes with surrounding universities. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Memorial Stadium (Boise). It was clearly privately built by an investor group led by Bill Pereira and son Cord Pereira. I could see that it was a longtime member of the Pioneer League. We admired the current seating capacity of 3&comma;452 on land owned by Ada County. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bus pulled up at Borah High School. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was the second high school in the Boise School District. It was clearly 1&comma;569; the 13th grade 10 students. It seemed a fine spot for physical education classes and extra-circular activities. I found and admired the school's original gymnasium. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Boise Towne Square. Unless I was mistaken, this was led by developer Ernest Hahn. My guidebook said it was added in its place in 1981. Passepartout observed that it wasn't included in the closure list released by the company. Things were different after it was demolished in October 2009 for a PetSmart store. We noted zoning and access problems. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near National Interagency Fire Center. My guidebook told me it was created to implement the Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy. I could see that it was founded to manage firefighting resources throughout the western states. We visited the National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for initial suppression." said Passepartout. We helped ourselves to unified guidance for fire agencies in the United States. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Taco Bell Arena. I remembered it was formally home to the Idaho Stampede. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the site of the 2013 second-round tie of the tennis Davis Cup between the United States and Serbia! Passepartout observed that it wasn't rebuilt as BSU dropped baseball as a varsity sport following the 1980 season. It seemed quite suitable for concerts (capacity 13&comma;390) and many community events. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Boise State University. Imagine my surprise to learn it was founded in 1932 as Boise Junior College by the Episcopal Church! Unless I was mistaken, this was renamed Boise State College. We visited the Boise State football and Track & Field programs. Passepartout remembered it becoming an independent junior college in 1934. We admired the smaller auditorium used for community productions. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for community productions." said Passepartout. I found and admired a smaller auditorium used for community productions. We took advantage of for a new set of buildings to be conceptualized. We enjoyed the legendary unique blue playing surface. He explained to us how it had been designed to be shaped roughly like the State of Idaho when viewed from above. <p class="new">We hailed a cab to Assay Office (Boise, Idaho). It looked as if it was the first major federal government building in the Idaho Territory. Passepartout said it was the third highest in the nation. I found and admired the State Historical Preservation Office and the Archaeological Survey of Idaho. Things were different after further gold strikes were made in the northern part of the state. We noted the playing out of surface mines. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Discovery Center of Idaho, we approached Boise, Idaho. Passepartout asked me if it was called Boise long before the establishment of Fort Boise by the federal government, but I did not know. It looked as if it was erected by the Hudson's Bay Company in the 1830s. We visited an all-female. We enjoyed authentic local products as part of the sesquicentennial. We joined some tourists who were admiring the thriving performing arts community. It was hard to believe it was ever a shibboleth. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the state's three largest cities; Boise. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the blue Field Turf field; and Taco Bell Arena!" said Passepartout. We met Alfred, an old friend of Passepartout's who worked nearby. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to Idaho State Capitol. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was a German immigrant who partnered with Tourtellotte in 1903. Passepartout said it was just over $2 million; it was completed in 1920. We visited the Idaho Supreme Court until it moved to the new Supreme Court Building in 1970. We admired the statue called the Patriot by Kenneth Lonn. It seemed quite suitable for hearings and committee meetings of the Joint Finance and Appropriations Committee. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a statue called the Patriot by Kenneth Lonn. Things were never the same after it moved to the new Supreme Court Building in 1970. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to The Egyptian Theatre (Boise, Idaho). Unless I was mistaken, this was remodeled once again after the original building. Passepartout asked me if it was featured on the Travel Channel show Ghost Stories in 2009, but I did not know. At this point, Alfred entered a nearby cinema and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I walked to Roman Catholic Diocese of Boise. To the best of my recollection, this was appointed to minister to them. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was thus celebrated by Fr. The mood here changed after his death in 1956; the state's only Catholic high school bears his name (Bishop Kelly High School). <p class="new">Thunder cracked in the distance as we approached U.S. Bank Plaza (Boise). As far as I knew, this was the tallest building in the state for over thirty years. Passepartout said it was the headquarters of the Idaho First National Bank. We met EmKay, an old friend of Passepartout's who was passing by. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Old Idaho State Penitentiary. Passepartout asked me if it was a functional prison from 1872 to 1973 in the western United States, but I did not know. I recalled it was constructed in the Territory of Idaho in 1870. Passepartout remarked that it didn't have separate quarters. I spent a few minutes examining museums. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was condemned for habitation. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked not too far from Concordia University School of Law. Unless I was mistaken, this was originally scheduled to open in 2009. If I remembered correctly, this was expected to close in April and be for about $2 million. Passepartout commented that it didn't have a law school. We visited the state supreme court and about half of all the lawyers in Idaho. I admired the collection of electronic and print resources. I found and admired a collection of electronic and print resources. We made full benefit of its law students with study carrels. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Christ Chapel (Boise, Idaho). Passepartout asked me if it was constructed in 1866 as St&period; Michael's Episcopal Church, but I did not know. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was used as a school house for St&period; Margaret's School! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a school house for St&period; Margaret's School?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather worsened as we approached Albertsons Stadium. Passepartout asked me if it was renamed in May 2014 when Albertsons, but I did not know. He said it was also a track & field stadium and hosted the NCAA track & field championships twice. Passepartout remembered it becoming the baseball field. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the unusual blue playing surface!" said Passepartout. He explained to us how it had been designed to keep the mid-afternoon sun of mid-October out of the players' eyes (but put it into the eyes of half of the spectators). Things were never the same after right field was displaced by the construction of the Student Union Building. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Boise Junior College Administration Building. I could see that it was designed by the Boise architectural firms of Tourtellotte & Hummel and Wayland & Fennell. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was built in 1940 to house nearly all of the functions of the newly established Boise Junior College. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder cracked in the distance as we approached Boise Union Pacific Depot. My guidebook claimed it was built in 1925 by the Union Pacific Railroad. It looked as if it was eventually extended further east and provided daily service from Chicago. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was extended further east and provided daily service from Chicago. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Boise greenbelt. I could see that it was appointed in 1969 to guide the City of Boise as it worked to develop the Greenbelt. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was adopted which required a minimum setback of 70 ft for all structures and parking areas. It seemed handy for the river corridor began to take hold. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Idaho Department of Juvenile Corrections. Passepartout and I admired the juvenile to gravitate to inappropriate/illegal behavior is a risk factor. We took advantage of the best possible opportunities for juveniles to lead productive lives in the future. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to treat juvenile offenders between 14 and 19 years of age who have serious drug and alcohol as well as other behavioral problems. <p class="new">A few streets away was Boise High School. Unless I was mistaken, this was approximately 1&comma;480. Passepartout asked me if it was serviced by Central High School, but I did not know. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't the well-known white brick building present today. We enjoyed dangerous high-pressure steam. Passepartout and I admired the long history of ROTC Cadets. It functioned well as classrooms and the Boise High School library until the 1990s tech building was constructed. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the humanities classes whereas this new building houses science. It was within convenient distance of physical activity. The mood here changed after the 1990s tech building was constructed. We avoided their efficiency in place of natural light. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked a short distance to Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist (Boise, Idaho). If I recalled correctly, this was dedicated on Christmas Eve 1870. Passepartout asked me if it was destroyed in a fire 18 days later, but I did not know. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to have two towers topped with spires flanking the main façade. We couldn't fail to notice the statue of St. John the Evangelist, regarded as the author of the Gospel of John. To think that somebody who was said to have lived and been buried should have such a statue in Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist (Boise, Idaho). <h2>Chapter 32</h2><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Boise River Diversion Dam. Passepartout asked me if it was completed it worked famously, but I did not know. I could see that it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. We enjoyed 1&comma;500 kilowatts of electricity for Arrowrock's camp. We admired its vertical shaft design. We took advantage of surplus power during times of peak demand. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Barber Dam. Passepartout asked me if it was constructed by the Barber Lumber Company between 1904 and 1906 to serve as a mill pond for timber, but I did not know. He said it was purchased by Ada County in 1977 and is currently operated by the Idaho Department of Water Resources. I spent a few minutes studying two Kaplan turbine generators with a combined capacity of 4. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Arrowrock Dam. My guidebook told me it was to be the most ambitious project to date for Reclamation. To the best of my knowledge, this was some 20 mi up the Boise River from the Boise River Diversion Dam. We enjoyed 1&comma;500 kilowatts of electricity for Arrowrock's camp. We considered its vertical shaft design. We took advantage of surplus power during times of peak demand. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a coach near Community School (Sun Valley, Idaho). Unless I was mistaken, this was established in 1973 as a secondary school and moved to its present location in 1975. We helped ourselves to pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade programs and its campus is located just south of the Sun Valley Resort alongside Trail Creek. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Transient Reactor Test Facility (TREAT). Passepartout asked me if it was designed by Argonne National Laboratory, but I did not know. It was clearly sparked by the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. I admired the neutron radiography facility on the west face of the reactor. We took advantage of time and spatial resolution of fuel motion during transients and in-place measurement of fuel distribution before. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to test reactor fuels and structural materials. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Near here was the site of KBYI. It was clearly originally KRIC when BYU-Idaho was a junior college formally known as Ricks College. As far as I knew, this was a junior college formally known as Ricks College. We visited commercial station KADQ which was a class A FM with 3000 watts. We enjoyed by BYU-Idaho students. We made full benefit of classical music. Things changed after . KBYI was originally KRIC when BYU-Idaho was a junior college formally known as Ricks College. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a coach near Brigham Young University–Idaho. I remembered it was known for the greater part of its history as Ricks College. I could see that it was established as a "stake academy" first. Passepartout observed that it didn't have a nearby temple. Passepartout remembered it becoming necessary to divide the geographical area designated by the LDS Church as the Bannock Stake. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a center for disaster relief operations?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. I found and admired a 15&comma;000-seat auditorium and a multi-purpose area large enough for 10 full basketball courts. We enjoyed the famous greater part of its history as Ricks College. We noted its geographic representation but also due to ethnicity and religion. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Rexburg Idaho Temple. I could see that it was dedicated on February 10. My guidebook said it was the first temple dedicated under the presidency of Thomas S&period; Monson. We moved on, disappointed by the death of Gordon B&period; Hinckley and his funeral planned for February 2. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a coach near Sugar-Salem High School. As far as I knew, this was previously housed in what is now the junior high. Passepartout asked me if it was listed as a top school in Redbook Magazine in 1994, but I did not know. Passepartout remembered it becoming a National Blue Ribbon School. Passepartout and I admired the graduation rate of 97 percent. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at String Lake Comfort Station. Passepartout told me it was originally located near the Jenny Lake ranger station. Imagine my surprise to learn it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 23! Passepartout took a photograph of the National Park Service Rustic style. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered Moran Bay Patrol Cabin. I could see that it was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps about 1932. Passepartout asked me if it was located in the northern backcountry of Grand Teton National Park, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for winter ranger patrols." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Jenny Lake Ranger Station Historic District. It looked as if it was the main point of visitor contact in Grand Teton National Park from the 1930s to 1960. Imagine my surprise to learn it was built as a cabin by Lee Mangus north of Moose! It was hard to believe it was ever a base for climbing rangers and to issue climbing permits. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Jenny Lake CCC Camp NP-4. Passepartout asked me if it was the largest Civilian Conservation Corps camp in Grand Teton, but I did not know. It looked as if it was later used as a base camp for mountain climbing concessioners. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a base camp for mountain climbing concessioners?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a coach near Chapel of the Transfiguration. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was sited and built to frame a view of the Cathedral Group of peaks in a large window behind the altar. Passepartout said it was donated by Maud Noble. We took advantage of shelter to the chain-operated bell. We met C&period;B&period;, a college friend of mine who was in the area. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Murie Ranch Historic District. C&period;B&period; told me it was president of the Wilderness Society. To the best of my knowledge, this was an advocate for the preservation of wild lands in America. I admired the separate exterior door. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was two guest units?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pumpkin House." said C&period;B&period;. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;C&period;B&period; told me about Murie Residence. Unless I was mistaken, this was the home of naturalists and conservationists Olaus and Mardie Murie. Passepartout said it was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 23. At this point, C&period;B&period; entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of Bar B C Dude Ranch. Passepartout told us a long story about  a cattle ranching operation. Passepartout asked me if it was established near Moose, but I did not know. It looked as if it was a strong influence on other dude ranches in the area. We enjoyed at the ranch by the early 1920s. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of Double Diamond Dude Ranch Dining Hall. I could see that it was opened in 1924 with a dozen tent cabins and log buildings for a kitchen and dining hall. It was clearly a local guide and former Bar B C Dude Ranch wrangler. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for dormitory-style climber accommodations." said Passepartout. He took several photographs of the rustic architecture. <p class="new">Our train arrived near Historical buildings and structures of Grand Teton National Park. Passepartout told me it was expanded to encompass nearly all of Jackson Hole. It looked as if it was built by J&period; Pierce Cunningham in 1885. Passepartout observed that it didn't arrive until 1884. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was the residence for its general manager?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. Passepartout examined the Teton Science School. Things were different after Lesher sold out to the Park Service in 1980. <h2>Chapter 33</h2><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near The Brinkerhoff. As far as I knew, this was then U&period;S&period; Forest Service land for the Brinkerhoff family. It looked as if it was purchased by Zachery K&period; Brinkerhoff Sr. We disagreed as to whether it was further developed in vacation homes throughout the West. We entered into conversation with a local shopkeeper, who introduced themselves as Scotty. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Jackson Lake Lodge. As far as I could remember, this was listed as a National Historic Landmark. Passepartout asked me if it was commonly seen in structures built on U&period;S&period; Government parklands in the mid-20th century, but I did not know. We admired its more modern design. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Scotty and I hitched a lift to Jackson Lake Dam. My guidebook claimed it was increased by the dam to provide water storage. Unless I was mistaken, this was a log-crib dam constructed in 1906-7 across the outlet of Jackson Lake. We helped ourselves to irrigation water from the Snake River for farmlands in Idaho. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Jackson Lake Ranger Station. Unless I was mistaken, this was administered by the Forest Service as part of Teton National Forest. My guidebook claimed it was one of five Forest Service stations in the area. Passepartout observed that it didn't wish the congressional delegation to see the damage. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a coach near Leek's Lodge. Passepartout asked me if it was specifically intended to offer activities to boys in a frontier setting, but I did not know. My guidebook said it was instrumental in the establishment of the National Elk Refuge in Jackson Hole. Did it offer activities to boys in a frontier setting? We thought so. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Construction of Mount Rushmore. I remembered it was a sculpture of each president intended to go down to their waists. It looked as if it was with Borglum for a total of seven years. Passepartout observed that it wasn't until 1998 that the National Park System. Scotty remembered it becoming a tradition for each of the Presidents' heads. We moved on, disappointed by poor rock quality. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Stratobowl. It looked as if it was reused by the U&period;S Navy Project Strato-Lab. Imagine my surprise to learn it was spread on the ground prior to inflation! Passepartout remarked that it wasn't ready until November. Passepartout was unimpressed by a stratospheric balloon launch site. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Rapid City Public Library. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was organized by community women with $45! Unless I was thinking of something else, this was opened at 610 Quincy St&period; In 2002. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a school library and closed to the public?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I said. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Central High School (Rapid City, South Dakota). Imagine my astonishment to learn it was changed from "Tigers" to "Cobblers" to honor former coach Euclid Cobb! Passepartout asked me if it was renovated and opened in the fall of 2013 as Rapid City High School again, but I did not know. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Scotty gave us a lift to Church of the Immaculate Conception (Rapid City, South Dakota). If I remembered correctly, this was relocated and became the Diocese of Rapid City in 1930. Passepartout asked me if it was renamed the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception at that time, but I did not know. Passepartout examined a community where Mass is celebrated in Latin since 1992. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember when the new cathedral was built?" asked Scotty. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Passepartout told me about Chapel Emmanuel Railroad Car. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was one of thirteen railroad cars used as chapels in the United States starting about 1890. I could see that it was the second car built for the Baptists and was the longest serving. Passepartout observed that it didn't include any of the interior necessities. It functioned well as chapels in the United States starting about 1890. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Dakota State University. My guidebook claimed it was founded as a normal school in 1881 as Madison Normal School with a mission to train teachers. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was the first school dedicated to training teachers in the Dakota Territory! We visited the Smith-Zimmermann Heritage Museum and the Karl E&period; Mundt Library and Archives. We admired the technology centric focus with programs in computer and information science. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"TECHNICALLY, WE'RE BETTER." said Scotty. <h2>Chapter 34</h2><p class="new">Our train arrived near Calumet Hotel (Pipestone, Minnesota). Passepartout asked me if it was built to replace a previous hotel, but I did not know. It looked as if it was destroyed in an 1886 fire. At this point, Scotty noticed the time and said they had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at The Brinkerhoff. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Pipestone Indian School Superintendent's House. Passepartout told me it was considered to be in immediate need of stabilization. As far as I knew, this was once a boarding school campus of more than 60 buildings. It seemed a fine spot for storage by the present owner. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Casey Jones State Trail. My guidebook told me it was one of the first Minnesota state trails to be established. It looked as if it was named for him as it was the first abandoned railroad grade acquired by the state. Passepartout observed that it didn't pass and a small appropriation was vetoed by the governor. It was handy for Pipestone National Monument. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Pipestone Water Tower. It was clearly built to replace an aged steel standpipe tower built in the late 1880s. To the best of my knowledge, this was commenced by the Campbell Construction Company in 1920 for $24&comma;610. I found and admired an unusual set of spiral windows and an internal staircase. The mood here changed after it was replaced by a larger tower in 1976. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Ironwood Springs Christian Ranch. My guidebook claimed it was Bardwell's goal to start a Christian camp of his own. As far as I knew, this was paralyzed from the waist down in a heavy construction accident. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to be 100% wheelchair accessible. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near La Crosse Center. I could see that it was a fifty-foot skywalk spanning over Second Street in downtown La Crosse. We visited countless exhibits and shows. It seemed a fine spot for trade shows. I spent a few minutes examining 9432 sqft of meeting room space in five meeting rooms. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Veterans Memorial Stadium (La Crosse). It was clearly demolished in 2008 and a new structure opened in 2009. Passepartout asked me if it was expanded to increase stadium seating to around 10&comma;000, but I did not know. It seemed quite suitable for football and track and field. I found and admired the Veterans Hall of Honor meeting room. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus not too far from La Crosse Queen. It looked as if it was built in 2008 at Skipperliner Marine on French Island. My guidebook said it was built with split sternwheels that are her only means of propulsion. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to look like and old sidewheel style showboat. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was La Crosse Rail Bridge. It was clearly one of the first 15 bridges across the Mississippi River. Imagine my surprise to learn it was designed and built in 1876 by Chicago! Passepartout commented that it didn't care for these bridges. I admired the much right to build a bridge to cross a river as another person has to travel up and down the water. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to La Crosse (Amtrak station) and caught an express train, alighting near Grandad Bluff. My guidebook claimed it was first purchased from the state by Judge George Gale in July 1851. If I remembered correctly, this was used as a source of construction materials. Passepartout observed that it didn't occupy this course before the Pleistocene. I admired the geomorphically young appearance because of its Pleistocene history. It functioned well as a source of construction materials. Passepartout was unimpressed by a panoramic photo of La Crosse taken in 2004. It was convenient for the bluff. We helped ourselves to access to the bluff. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Roman Catholic Diocese of La Crosse. My guidebook told me it was established by Pope Pius IX on March 3. I could see that it was taken from what was then the Diocese of Milwaukee. We visited the Jesuit-run Campion High School until its closing in 1975. <h2>Chapter 35</h2><p class="new">We alighted from a coach near Wildcat Mountain State Park. It looked as if it was known as the "river of canoes" to the Indians who lived in the area. If I remembered correctly, this was canoes that brought the first European explorers to the area. Passepartout observed that it wasn't changed until 1862 to Vernon. We visited the Meskwaki and Sac Indians and later the Ho-Chunk. We joined some tourists who were admiring the woodland ecosystem. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the many miles of slow moving waters that flow through wild areas!" said Passepartout. We looked for Congregationalist churches but weren't able to find any. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Mt. Olympus Water & Theme Park. Passepartout asked me if it was started by the Laskaris family, but I did not know. It was clearly operated for 5 years. Passepartout remarked that it didn't approve the event. We admired the drop height of 134 ft and contains a section of underground track which is banked to a 90° angle. I found and admired a section of underground track which is banked to a 90° angle. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was sold to Bluegreen Resorts and now operates at Bluegreen Odyssey Dells. We met Todd, an old friend of mine who worked nearby. We noted a cable snapping before two riders were launched into the air. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Noah's Ark Water Park. Passepartout told me it was purchased by Palace Entertainment. My guidebook claimed it was taken down and replaced with Scorpion's Tail. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a museum/storage facility at the time of the fire?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Kilbourn Public Library. I remembered it was built in 1912 and designed by Claude & Starck. It was clearly moved next to the new building. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for offices." said Passepartout. We enjoyed the famous library plans. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Near here was the site of Portage Canal. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was built to connect the Fox River and Wisconsin River at Portage. It was clearly not completed until 1876 by the Army Corps of Engineers. We noted a rupture of the 1876 wooden gate and the quoin post of the west gate of the lock in April 1926. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We doubled back to Portage Municipal Airport and arranged passage on a passenger boat. Some time later, it docked near Pardeeville Presbyterian Church and we walked the rest of the way. It looked as if it was more common in residential buildings. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 15. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Lizard Mound County Park. Passepartout told me it was acquired by Washington County from the state of Wisconsin in 1986. I remembered it was acquired by Washington County from the State of Wisconsin in 1986. Did it represent the same animal? We thought so. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a significant well-preserved effigy mound group. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  retraced our steps to West Bend Municipal Airport and arranged passage on the next boat. Some time later, it docked near West Bend Municipal Airport and we walked the rest of the way. We admired the left traffic pattern. We took advantage of 100 octane low lead fuel as well as Jet-A fuel. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at WSJP-FM. If I remembered correctly, this was owned by Joel Kinlow until he sold the station to Starboard. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was canonized as a saint on April 27 of the same year! Passepartout remarked that it didn't penetrate the southern half of Milwaukee County. Times certainly changed after he sold the station to Starboard. We noted its location and limited signal. <p class="new">Our train arrived near Grafton High School (Wisconsin). To the best of my recollection, this was third in the state and first in the conference. It was clearly ranked 559th in the country and fifth in the state. I admired the student enrollment of around 900. We took advantage of students with educational opportunities such as core subjects. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus not too far from Kevich Light. It looked as if it was built privately by a person who has a general interest in lighthouses. Passepartout asked me if it was officially registered as an United States Coast Guard Class II Private Aid Light, but I did not know. We admired the general interest in lighthouses. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Concordia University Wisconsin. Passepartout asked me if it was opened in 1881 at Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church in downtown Milwaukee, but I did not know. It looked as if it was to prepare young men for pastoral careers in the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod. We visited both CUW's men's baseball and the Lakeshore Chinooks. Passepartout and I admired the synthetic turf field. I spent a while examining humorous fictional stories and is distributed by secret editorial staff. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to prepare students for a variety of careers within the pharmacy profession. We avoided CUAA's financial troubles. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Cardinal Stritch University. My guidebook claimed it was renamed Cardinal Stritch College in honor of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee's Samuel Cardinal Stritch. It looked as if it was subsequently accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1953. Passepartout recounted how it had been accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1953. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down not too far from Sprecher Brewery. It was clearly founded in 1985 in Milwaukee by Randal Sprecher. Passepartout said it was employed by Pabst in Milwaukee. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a primary ingredient in its root beer and Sprecher Ginger Ale uses real?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. We took some time to enjoy the famous Black Bavarian (Schwarzbier)and premium sodas. We met Charlie, a college friend of mine who was passing by. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie gave us a lift to WXSS. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was created and is programmed by Brian Kelly. Passepartout asked me if it was a huge ratings success for the following two decades, but I did not know. Charlie and I enjoyed by former Production Coordinator/Primary Fill-In & Weekend Jock Will Calder. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rhythm & Romance." said Charlie. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Charlie and I hitched a lift to WITI TV Tower. It looked as if it was completed in August 1962 and was briefly the tallest free-standing tower in the world. My guidebook said it was briefly the tallest free-standing tower in the world. Things were different after a move to WVTV's tower in 1981 (eventually moving to the new digital-ready MPTV Tower in 1999). We moved on, unsure what to make of WOC-TV of Davenport. <p class="new">A few streets away was WMIL-FM. To the best of my recollection, this was voted "Top Country Station in a Large Market". We made full benefit of news and weather content to iHeartMedia's Milwaukee stations. We moved on, avoiding an anomalous quirk between the lower VHF TV and FM bands. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to WKLH. It looked as if it was an immediate success. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was let go by Saga after her contract was not renewed. We enjoyed by Marcus Allen. Things were never the same after flipping formats to classic hits as WKLH in 1986. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to WKTI. Imagine my surprise to learn it was a pioneer of FM broadcasting! I remembered it was renamed WTMJ-FM and it moved to the 88-108 MHz band. Passepartout remarked that it didn't make changes in response to the competition. Passepartout was unimpressed by the WKTI call sign at its adult standards station in Powell. Things were different after Journal's sale of the station to local interests in December 2012. We ignored WTMJ's coverage of a sudden flash flood situation. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Benjamin Church House (Shorewood, Wisconsin). Unless I was very much mistaken, this was built during 1843-1844 by a pioneer carpenter of that name in Kilbourntown. I recalled it was constructed in Greek Revival style architecture with four front columns and symmetry of floor plan. At this point, Charlie reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return home via Sprecher Brewery. We noted a city renumbering project. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Shorewood High School (Wisconsin). It looked as if it was renovated and now houses the Community Fitness Center. Passepartout asked me if it was the first high school in its area to perform the musical "A Chorus Line" in 1986, but I did not know. I found and admired the Community Fitness Center. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Klotsche Center. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was named after UWM's first Chancellor! We visited the Milwaukee Panthers men's and women's basketball teams and the women's volleyball team. Passepartout disapproved of it being moving its men's basketball games from U&period;S&period; Cellular Arena back to the Klotsche Center for the 2012-2013 season. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. It was clearly founded with the belief that Milwaukee needed a great public university to become a great city. We visited the only graduate school of freshwater science in the U&period;S&period;. We admired the total student enrollment of 27&comma;813 and 1&comma;623 faculty members. Did it prevent overflows and backups into neighboring homes? We thought not. I found and admired the Departments of Sociology. It was convenient for public bus transportation in Milwaukee. We took advantage of students learning spaces to study and work together. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to expand UWM's research enterprise through investment in projects with anticipated return on investment through extramural funding. We traversed the Ernest Spaights Plaza. The mood here changed after Marquette disbanded its program in 2011. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Riverside University High School. Passepartout asked me if it was at a Jefferson St&period; location in its founding year of 1868, but I did not know. I remembered it was known at the time as Folsom Place. Passepartout observed that it didn't have a school cafeteria and lacked a full library. It seemed perfect for rehearsal purposes as well as final dress rehearsals. Was it a new pool? We thought not. It was convenient for the auditorium and two stairwells to access either basement level gym. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to bear the weight of the building. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Thomas A. Greene Memorial Museum. Passepartout told me it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was given to Greene by the scientist Increase A&period; Lapham. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really academic space for UWM's Sam and Helen Stahl Center for Jewish Studies?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. Passepartout was unimpressed by a wide range of minerals and ores from localities throughout North America. <p class="new">We wandered to Engelmann Field. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was renamed Laura Moynihan Field at Engelmann Stadium in 2011. Passepartout said it was renamed Laura Moynihan Field and the Engelmann name was attached to the stadium overall. We visited the Milwaukee Panthers men's and women's soccer teams. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of Charles Allis Art Museum. Unless I was mistaken, this was originally the home of Milwaukee native Charles Allis and his wife. Passepartout asked me if it was the first president of the Allis-Chalmers Corporation, but I did not know. I found and admired a collection of paintings. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun came out as we approached Cleopatra's Wedge. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was exhibited in New York's Battery Park! It looked as if it was part of a land swap with the City of Milwaukee to expand available green space. I admired the option to purchase the piece for $225&comma;000. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It began to rain as we approached Juneau Monument. Passepartout asked me if it was a French Canadian born in a small village near Montreal, but I did not know. If I remembered correctly, this was a French trader with the American Fur Company. We admired the statue of Solomon Juneau, a fur trader. It seemed fitting somebody who was selling plots of land in Juneautown should have such a statue in Juneau Monument. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Milwaukee Art Museum. It was clearly still a growing port town with little or no facilities to hold major art exhibitions. As far as I knew, this was created by a group of German panorama artists and local businessmen. I spent over an hour studying a movable. We were approached by a local resident, who introduced themselves as David. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Discovery World. Unless I was mistaken, this was initially known as the Science. My guidebook claimed it was the Milwaukee Public Library. We visited Wisconsin's official flagship. I spent a few minutes studying interactive exhibits. It was convenient for pro-level software and screen printing equipment. We took advantage of an array of maritime experiences. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to teach visitors how to understand water as a resource. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Hoan Bridge. Unless I was mistaken, this was renamed after Daniel Hoan. It was clearly designed by the firm Howard. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was the site of the car chase scene in the movie The Blues Brothers?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Bridge to Nowhere." said David. We noted public backlash against the planned Milwaukee County freeway system. <p class="new">Passing Marcus Amphitheater, we approached Jones Island, Milwaukee. I remembered it was made in 1857 and is still in use today. Passepartout asked me if it was later filled to provide railroad access, but I did not know. We visited the Port of Milwaukee. It seemed perfect for a system of docking terminals. Passepartout was unimpressed by a couple of mature trees. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Rockwell Automation Headquarters and Allen-Bradley Clock Tower. As far as I knew, this was kept and modified to display the outdoor temperature using a large digital display. My guidebook claimed it was unlit from November 1973 to June 1974. We admired the diameter of 40 feet. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a navigation aid for Lake Michigan mariners over the years?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I said. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The largest four-faced clock is that on the research and office addition of the Allen-Bradley Company." said David. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun came out as we approached St. Stanislaus Catholic Church (Milwaukee). It looked as if it was designed by Polish nobleman Leonard Kowalski. It was clearly founded in 1866 by immigrant Poles in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"How difficult it was for us to obtain a second Polish bishop, and how easy to lose him." said David. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Basilica of St. Josaphat. I recalled it was dedicated to Josaphat Kuncevyc. My guidebook claimed it was founded in 1888 by immigrant Poles on Milwaukee's (then) far south side. It seemed quite suitable for material storage and sorting as it came off the railroad flatcars. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;David gave us a lift to South Division High School. If I remembered correctly, this was built after an 1890 motion by the Milwaukee Board of School Directors. It was clearly granted permission to open a school lunch room in the building. I admired the collection of old South Division memorabilia. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a collection of old South Division memorabilia. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Christ Evangelical Lutheran Church. Passepartout asked me if it was designed by architect Frederick Velguth in the German Gothic Revival style and built in 1901, but I did not know. I remembered it was almost complete for the December 1. Passepartout observed that it wasn't finished and the trumpets froze in the cold church. I spent some time examining gold leafing. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory. Passepartout asked me if it was extensively redesigned in the summer of 2008, but I did not know. He said it was closed during the summer of 2008 to facilitate the replacement of 800 cracked glass panels. We visited a number of colorful birds. We enjoyed a double red-colored cone. Passepartout was unimpressed by a large number of plants native to the Sonoran Desert. <p class="new">Moving on, we arrived at Menomonee Valley. My guidebook claimed it was also a primary source of pollution for the river. Passepartout asked me if it was established by Jacques Vieau in 1795, but I did not know. We visited the Milwaukee Road. We considered its photogenic design. Passepartout was unimpressed by the company's vast collection of historic motorcycles and corporate archives. It was within convenient distance of Lake Michigan and other waterways. We noted Milwaukee's dominant German immigrant population. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Marquette University. If I remembered correctly, this was founded by John Martin Henni. Passepartout said it was named after 17th century missionary and explorer Father Jacques Marquette. We visited stadiums for the track and field. Passepartout remembered it becoming affiliated with a local medical school. We enjoyed theater and performs in a traditional theater setting. We joined some tourists who were admiring the student body of about 12&comma;000. Did it motivate and enable low-income and first generation students? We were not sure. I found and admired the university's College of Communication. We made full benefit of members with an opportunity to develop and share musical talents through participation in a large-group setting. Things were different after the university purchased it for use as graduate apartments. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Golden Eagles." said David. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Marquette Interchange. I could see that it was officially opened on August 19. It looked as if it was at the time the largest construction project in state history. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to ensure the safe and efficient flow of traffic. We encounted some problems with major design flaws. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It began to rain as we approached Calvary Presbyterian Church (Milwaukee). It was clearly designed by Milwaukee architect Henry C&period; Koch in Gothic Revival style and built in 1870. My guidebook claimed it was inspired by a 12th-century labyrinth found at the Cathedral of Chartres in Chartres. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Shops of Grand Avenue. Passepartout asked me if it was named after a bustling merchant street during the 19th century, but I did not know. It looked as if it was opened during a time when many downtown retail centers in major cities were shutting down. We took advantage of hourly fee parking. We noted competition from newly renovated malls in nearby suburbs. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky darkened as we approached Pabst Theater. Passepartout asked me if it was also designated a National Historic Landmark in 1991, but I did not know. It looked as if it was destroyed by fire in January 1895. We visited the German theater company for many years. Passepartout and I admired the hydraulic orchestra pit. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the opulence as well as its role in German-American culture in Milwaukee!" said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Marcus Center. Imagine my amazement to learn it was designed in the Brutalist style by noted Chicago architect Harry Weese! Passepartout asked me if it was suddenly enacted into a bill mainly concerned with creating a new NBA arena, but I did not know. I admired the seating capacity of 2&comma;305. We made full benefit of to the Marcus Center. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"One day Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele got up and decided he'd like to change the governance of the Marcus Center for the Performing Arts." said David. <p class="new">It was a short walk to Milwaukee School of Engineering. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was founded in 1903 by Oscar Werwath and initially called the School of Engineering of Milwaukee. Passepartout said it was designed by industrial engineer Brooks Stevens. I spent some time examining classrooms. At this point, David entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Milwaukee City Hall. Passepartout told me it was the tallest habitable building in the United States. Imagine my surprise to learn it was Milwaukee's tallest building until completion of the First Wisconsin Center in 1973! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a municipal icon and in some traffic and parking signs?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I said. Things were never the same after completion of the First Wisconsin Center in 1973. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Cathedral Church of All Saints (Milwaukee). I could see that it was designed by E&period; Townsend Mix. It looked as if it was sold to the Episcopal diocese in 1871 when the Olivet congregation faced bankruptcy. I admired the bronze bell cast in Pittsburgh. Passepartout was unimpressed by a bronze bell cast in Pittsburgh. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to First Church of Christ, Scientist (Milwaukee, Wisconsin). Passepartout asked me if it was designed in the Classical Revival style by noted Chicago architect Solon Spencer Beman, but I did not know. He said it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at The Calling (di Suvero). Passepartout pointed out  the Milwaukee Art Museum. Imagine my surprise to learn it was made in 1981-82 from steel I-beams painted an orange-red color! Unless I was mistaken, this was commissioned by an anonymous donor. Passepartout observed that it didn't extend to its present location. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Birds of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was once a wealthy neighborhood and to this day still retains its wealth. Passepartout said it was commissioned to make a public artwork for Milwaukee. We had agood view of the public work from here. I spent a while examining six separate pieces. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm frightened by crowds of people, birds or even insects swarming in great masses." said Santiago. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Santiago and I walked to Wisconsin Gas Building. It looked as if it was formerly on the site. I remembered it was purchased by Wisconsin Energy in 2001. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a harbor marker and navigation aid by mariners in Lake Michigan over the years?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. <p class="new">We wandered a short distance to Federal Building (Milwaukee, Wisconsin). I recalled it was constructed in 1892-99. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was persuaded to fund a new! It seemed perfect for many public events. We helped ourselves to the greatest display of Romanesque ornament. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Immigrant Mother (sculpture). I could see that it was the force behind the creation of Immigrant Mother. Passepartout said it was a newspaper business manager in Milwaukee born from German parents. Passepartout took notes on the this homage. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Due to his distinguished public service career, Bruce gained the sobriquet 'Mr&period; Milwaukee." said Santiago. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Milwaukee Breakwater Light. Santiago told me it was originally painted red. Passepartout asked me if it was transferred from the Milwaukee Pierhead Light, but I did not know. Santiago and I admired the square Balcony and "round cast iron lantern room that features helical astragals" in the lantern. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Milwaukee Pierhead Light. Passepartout pointed out  a short pier. Passepartout told me it was transferred to the Milwaukee Breakwater Light. It was clearly listed on the National Register of Historic Places in September 2012. We admired the round steel tower with a round gallery and a ten-sided lantern. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original lantern room had helical bar windows and is believed to be the one presently on the Breakwater Light." said Santiago. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Stratiformis (sculpture). It was clearly a knitting company that created wool hats. I could see that it was the last company to create these goods in the United States. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kim, Jin Soo." said Santiago. We moved on, unsure what to make of episodes like Tilted Arc and the regularity of public art controversy. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Harley-Davidson Museum. It was clearly built in an historically industrial area of Milwaukee. My guidebook said it was formerly used by the Milwaukee Department of Public Works. Santiago and I enjoyed on "Fat Bob" tanks. I spent a few minutes studying more than 450 Harley-Davidson motorcycles and hundreds of thousands of artifacts from the Harley-Davidson Motor Company's 110-year history. At this point, Santiago departed from our company, saying that they had to return home via University Club Tower (Milwaukee). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled to Family (Blumenfeld). Unless I was very much mistaken, this was installed in the Henry Reuss Federal Plaza in 1983. Passepartout asked me if it was the brainchild of US House member Henry S&period; Reuss, but I did not know. We took advantage of a channel for her imagination. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun came out as we approached Germania Building. My guidebook claimed it was built in 1896 for George Brumder to house the headquarters of his burgeoning publishing empire. I remembered it was designed by German-trained architects Schnetzky & Liebert and was. We noted the statue of Germania (personification), the personification of the German nation or the Germans as a whole. We were impressed that somebody who was sometimes shown as carrying or wearing the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire should have such a statue in Germania Building. <p class="new">With no time to spare, we ran to Letter Carriers' Monument. Passepartout told me it was commissioned in celebration of the centennial of the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC). He asked me if it was commissioned through the Franz Bader Gallery in New York to create the monument, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for storage by Renaissance Books." said Passepartout. I found and admired the headquarters of Manpower Inc. We entered into conversation with a local resident, who introduced themselves as Jack. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"In honor of the men and women/ who have delivered for America/ in rain, sleet, and snow." said Jack. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered to Oneida Street Station. Imagine my amazement to learn it was a power plant operated by The Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Company! My guidebook claimed it was designed by architect Herman Esser in neoclassical revival style. Passepartout examined the Patty and Jay Baker Theater Complex and the Milwaukee Repertory Theater. We moved on, disappointed by the greater efficiency of the process. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Wisconsin Consistory Building. I remembered it was 470 Van Buren before the street was renumbered. It looked as if it was extensively remodeled including the removal of chimneys flanking the corner dome. I admired the chapel. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a rental wedding and banquet hall?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. I spent a short time examining approximately 22000 sqft. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Abraham Lincoln (Cecere). Imagine my surprise to learn it was donated by schoolchildren! Passepartout asked me if it was designed by Ferdinand Eisman, but I did not know. Passepartout said that he didn't grow a beard until he was 52. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was placed in front of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks Club on East Wisconsin Avenue. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"With malice toward none." said Jack. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With some urgency, we ran to Wind Leaves (Kahn). I could see that it was paid for by an anonymous donor. Passepartout said it was originally designed to be placed near a grove of trees in Veteran's Park. Passepartout and I admired the musical component as well. We took advantage of a sparkling surface that reflects its surroundings such as the lakefront. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to be placed near a grove of trees in Veteran's Park. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enlisting Nature; Wind, Lake, Sky Combine to Create Art on Milwaukee's Shore." said Jack. <h2>Chapter 36</h2><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Berlin Raceway. To the best of my knowledge, this was changed due to Anti-German sentiment following World War II. Passepartout asked me if it was also a stop on the American Speed Association tour before the series folded, but I did not know. We ignored Anti-German sentiment following World War II. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Grand Valley State University. My guidebook told me it was opened in 1998 and was named for the Meijer Family for their generous donation of land. I could see that it was named for the Meijer Family for their generous donation of land. I admired the large undergraduate enrollment and emphasis. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a prop in parodies of the music video "Wrecking Ball" by Miley Cyrus?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. It was handy for higher level art studies. We took advantage of law enforcement services for the Allendale Campus. At this point, Jack entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to GVSU Fieldhouse. If I recalled correctly, this was created as a multipurpose facility; in addition to intercollegiate events. Passepartout and I admired the large attendance present at sporting events held in the GVSU Fieldhouse. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't imagine a worse place for intramural sports." said Passepartout. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near WMAX-FM. Passepartout asked me if it was generally being used as a simulcast to WHTC, but I did not know. I remembered it was softened to adult contemporary by 1985. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't able to effectively compete with WCUZ-FM 101. Passepartout remembered it becoming a fully automated CHR station. We enjoyed play by play sportscasts and sports talk programs. It functioned well as a simulcast to WHTC. Things changed after flipping to an all-news format in 1976. We moved on, avoiding Clear Channel being above the ownership limits allowed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near WJQK. Passepartout told me it was moved three miles east to where 72nd Avenue would cross the highway. If I remembered correctly, this was Blessed by Rachael Lampa. Things were never the same after Lanser Broadcasting purchased the station and changed them to WJQK in January 1987. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near RiverTown Crossings. Passepartout asked me if it was developed by General Growth Properties of Chicago, but I did not know. It looked as if it was also featured as a junior anchor. It was handy for this location with the stipulation that service to the mall ends when the mall is closed. We encounted some problems with rowdy behavior and several violent incidents. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bus pulled up at Lee High School (Wyoming, Michigan). Passepartout asked me if it was considering awarding varsity letters to outstanding readers as well as athletes, but I did not know. Passepartout remarked that it didn't want to renew the lease. Passepartout remembered it becoming the location of the athletic complex. We had an excellent view of the gate to Lee Field from here. It functioned well as a junior high assembly. Passepartout mourned it having been eliminated in the semi-finals by the Bridgman team. The mood here changed after Lee faced North Muskegon on September 23. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near John Ball Zoological Garden. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the first zoo in Michigan to receive accreditation! It was clearly donated to the city by noted pioneer and explorer John Ball upon his death in 1884. I admired the variety of animals from around the world and is a significant regional attraction. I found and admired a variety of animals from around the world and is a significant regional attraction. We helped ourselves to a four-minute ride to the upper areas of the park. We looked for aging animals but weren't able to find any. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Aquinas College (Michigan). My guidebook told me it was reorganized as Catholic Junior College. It looked as if it was renamed in honor of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Passepartout remembered it becoming the first Catholic college in the US to go co-ed. Passepartout and I admired the Catholic heritage. We took advantage of a liberal arts education with a global perspective. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to increase underrepresented student involvement and success by promoting community building. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to President Gerald R. Ford, Jr. Boyhood Home. If I remembered correctly, this was a great hideaway because my parents wouldn't climb the ladder to the second floor-- or so I thought. I could see that it was completed by Third Coast Color Painting Co. <p class="new">Our next stop was Heritage Hill Historic District (Grand Rapids, Michigan). Unless I was very much mistaken, this was designated by the American Planning Association as one of 2012's Great Places in America. I recalled it was lost was the Bissell house. We visited about 4&comma;400 residents and covers an area of about 3500 acre. We took advantage of neighbors a way of collectively building a healthy. We met Frank, a college friend of mine who was in the area. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With some urgency, we walked to Grand Rapids Public Library. Unless I was mistaken, this was founded in 1871 and was located within the Grand Rapids City Hall. To the best of my knowledge, this was located within the Grand Rapids City Hall. I admired the service area of roughly 197&comma;000 people. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Fountain Street Church. My guidebook told me it was for a time unique in the United States as being large. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was a leader in the movement. Passepartout observed that it didn't approve of union tactics. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the liberal approach to religious studies!" said Passepartout. He explained to us how it had been designed to inspire wonder and compassion toward self. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Justice, Liberty, Peace and Fraternity." said Frank. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Rosa Parks Circle. My guidebook claimed it was designed by Maya Lin who is famous for her work on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was Monroe Mall Amphitheater. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to represent the sky of Michigan as it appeared at midnight. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Roger B. Chaffee Planetarium. I recalled it was constructed in the early 1960s as part of the Public Museum of Grand Rapids. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was dedicated as the Roger B&period; Chaffee Planetarium! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the many educational programs!" said Passepartout. At this point, Frank entered a nearby museum and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This was also the location of Grand Rapids Public Museum. I could see that it was founded in 1854 as the "Grand Rapids Lyceum of Natural History". It was clearly the residence of the Carl Voigt family for over 76 years. Passepartout examined the Roger B&period; Chaffee Planetarium. We took advantage of a means to bring out artifacts from many of the museum's collections e&period;g&period; "D is for Dolls" The "Newcomers" exhibition is the most recent permanent exhibition at the Public Museum. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to DeVos Place Convention Center. Unless I was mistaken, this was originally called the Grand Center. To the best of my knowledge, this was unveiled in June 2002 as part of the DeVos Place Expansion project. We visited the Grand Rapids Symphony and Broadway Grand Rapids. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Belknap Lookout. Imagine my surprise to learn it was purchased from the government in 1831 by Charles Dexter! My guidebook said it was included in the original organization of the city of Grand Rapids. Passepartout observed that it didn't occur within the neighborhood until 1874. Passepartout was unimpressed by the city's first cemetery. It was handy for the neighborhood from downtown. <p class="new">We walked to Van Andel Institute. Passepartout pointed out  the development of safer. I remembered it was accredited by the HLC on November 12. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was completed in 2000 and Phase II opened in December 2009! We took advantage of science education programs to inspire and prepare students to pursue science or science-related professions. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to recall images of a river. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Grand Rapids Medical Corridor North Pedestrian Tunnel, we approached Crescent Park (Grand Rapids, MI). Passepartout told me it was deeded to the city for use as a park in October 1858. He asked me if it was originally bisected by a flight of 56 stone steps, but I did not know. I found and admired a steep hill which was originally bisected by a flight of 56 stone steps. We made full benefit of a quiet patch of green space near to the heart of the growing city. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Calvin College. Passepartout asked me if it was first published in 1907, but I did not know. It was clearly the southeast edge of Grand Rapids at the time. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't without its challenges. We visited the combined health. We argued over the merits of its set of design. We admired the number of classrooms and houses the Kinesiology department. It seemed perfect for basketball. Passepartout was unimpressed by the Honors Program office. We took advantage of students with the opportunity to foster an academically focused living-learning community. Things were different after fully transitioning to the Knollcrest Campus in 1973. We met Dobson, an old friend of Passepartout's who pulled up in a car. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Marriage is understood by the college and the Christian Reformed Church, with which it is affiliated, to be a covenantal union between a man and a woman." said Dobson. We encounted some problems with the band's name referring to pornography. <h2>Chapter 37</h2><p class="new">We parked near Fallasburg Bridge. Dobson told me it was patented by Josiah Brown of Buffalo. It was clearly thus briefly popular in Michigan but did not gain wide acceptance elsewhere. Passepartout observed that it didn't gain wide acceptance elsewhere. We admired the inside clearance of 12 ft. I spent some time studying no upright compression members and uses no iron except for bolt connectors at the timber intersections. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was destroyed by ice jams and flooding. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down not too far from Whites Bridge. I remembered it was a 120-foot (37 m) span Brown truss covered bridge. Imagine my surprise to learn it was located north of the Fallasburg Bridge and south of Smyrna! Passepartout commented that it didn't gain wide acceptance elsewhere. I spent a while perusing no upright compression members and no iron except for bolt connectors at the timber intersections. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was reopened to automobile traffic. Things were never the same after it incurred major structural damage. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Mission Network News. Unless I was mistaken, this was started in 1991 by World Concern. We enjoyed by The Raymond Group or TRG until 1995 when Cornerstone University acquired the broadcast ministry. We took advantage of news and information on the radio and interview. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mission Network News is a mission news service dedicated to keeping Christians informed on evangelical mission activity around the world." said Dobson. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It began to rain as we approached Cornerstone University. Dobson told me it was founded in 1941 as the Baptist Bible Institute. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was accredited in 1972 as a degree-granting college! We joined some tourists who were admiring the four faced clock near its top. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at WCXG. Passepartout asked me if it was originally transmitting on was used by WEHB (East Hills Broadcasters) for a number of years, but I did not know. It was clearly used by WEHB (East Hills Broadcasters) for a number of years. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to protect Hope College's student station. Things were different after local listenership and financial support allowed them to program locally. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Total Axxess." said Dobson. We noted a directional pattern designed to protect Hope College's student station. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near WLAV-FM. Passepartout asked me if it was a simulcast of WLAV 1340 in its early days, but I did not know. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was sued for the death of two people and the injury of two people at its popular raft race event. Passepartout remembered it becoming western Michigan's first full-time AOR station and was an instant success. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grand Rapids' Goldmine." said Dobson. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Fifth Third Ballpark. It looked as if it was featured on an episode of Man v&period; Food. Passepartout asked me if it was originally built in 1994 as Old Kent Park, but I did not know. We visited the West Michigan Whitecaps. We admired the seating capacity of 9&comma;684. It seemed quite suitable for other events including motorsports and concerts. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near DeltaPlex Arena. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was built in 1952 and since then the DeltaPlex sports! I recalled it was home to Alantic Mills Department Store. Passepartout and I admired the 52 ft ceiling. We avoided a reconstruction of West River Drive. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near WXSP-CD. It was clearly a translator for World Harvest Television from WHME-TV in South Bend. Passepartout said it was in an early pre-digital format comparable to the now defunct NBC Weather Plus. Passepartout remembered it becoming a UPN affiliate on August 31. We thought it was operated by Fox Television Stations and its syndication division Twentieth Television. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! The coverage of local sports in both the Grand Rapids and Detroit areas!" said Passepartout. The mood here changed after it switched to a general entertainment programming format a few years later. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near WFGR. My guidebook claimed it was previously a classical music station throughout the 1990s. I remembered it was displaced by rock station WKLQ. Passepartout remarked that it didn't renew the contract for the show. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Serving West Michigan." said Dobson. We avoided low ratings. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of Ramona Park. Imagine my surprise to learn it was an amusement park located in the city of East Grand Rapids! It looked as if it was located on the west shore of Reeds Lake in East Grand Rapids. I admired the room dedicated to the amusement park with artifacts. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus not too far from Van Noord Arena. I remembered it was built in 2009 and is home to Calvin College's Knights basketball and volleyball teams. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was converted into a recreational facility. I found and admired a luxury suite that can hold 40 fans. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Grand Rapids Christian High School. Unless I was mistaken, this was the last year for college prep students at Calvin College and Seminary. It looked as if it was divided by the Grand Rapids Christian School Association into two new high schools. I admired the number of extracurricular activities for students. Things changed after facilities were expanded at the Plymouth Avenue campus. We entered into conversation with a passer-by, who introduced themselves as Merle. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Forest Hills Central High School. Imagine my surprise to learn it was memorable for its campus style construction consisting eventually of thirteen separate buildings! My guidebook said it was completely rebuilt with the exception of the auditorium. We admired the smaller jazz choir that rehearses before school. We admired the famous music programs. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a coach near Whitney Tavern Stand. I recalled it was created from Ada Township. My guidebook claimed it was providing stagecoach service between Battle Creek and Kalamazoo. Passepartout admitted that he wasn't to enjoy his prosperity for long. I admired the small chimney vent. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a meat house/smokehouse at one time?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I said. Passepartout was unimpressed by the hotel/tavern's dining area and bar. It seemed handy for the second-story ballroom. We took advantage of access to the kitchen. The mood here changed after around 1870 when the Grand River Valley Railroad. <p class="new">We doubled back to Davenport University and arranged passage on a passenger boat. Some time later, it docked near Davenport University and we walked the rest of the way. Imagine my surprise to learn it was founded in 1866 by Conrad Swensburg and currently offers Associate's! My guidebook said it was founded in 1866 by Carl G&period; Swensburg. I admired the faculty-student ratio of 20:1 and an acceptance rate of 93%. I spent a few minutes perusing one academic building. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near WGVU (AM). Passepartout asked me if it was for many years the home of WMAX, but I did not know. If I remembered correctly, this was in the late 1950s and early 1960s the leading Top 40 music station in Grand Rapids. We enjoyed all-news radio format from 1976-1984. The mood here changed after Grand Valley returned it to the air in 1992. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"GOOD MAX MUSIC 1480." said Merle. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder cracked in the distance as we approached East Kentwood High School. Unless I was mistaken, this was completed to shelter students crossing each wing. It looked as if it was named East Kentwood because there were plans to eventually build a second high school. I admired the student population of over 2&comma;600 students. It seemed a fine spot for girl's aerobic and fitness training. We took some time to enjoy the legendary musicians that venture into mediums other than the standard classical repertoire. At this point, Merle entered a nearby shop and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital. Imagine my amazement to learn it was the most common name at the time! Passepartout asked me if it was launched in June 2011 to provide better access to Mary Free Bed doctors, but I did not know. It was convenient for Mary Free Bed doctors. We helped ourselves to rehabilitation services for pediatric and adult patients through inpatient. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Interurban Transit Partnership. It looked as if it was renamed the Grand Rapids Area Transit Authority. My guidebook claimed it was launched shortly after the new buses were introduced. We admired the stop immediately to the station's north on Cherry Street. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a transfer on other routes?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I said. It was within convenient distance of reduced fare ten-ride and 31-day passes. We helped ourselves to bus service to the Grand Rapids. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to ferry Grand Valley State Uuniversity students between its main campus located in Allendale and Pew Campus in downtown Grand Rapids. We moved on, disappointed by route 50 serving CDC. <h2>Chapter 38</h2><p class="new">We alighted from a coach near Ionia Correctional Facility. Passepartout asked me if it was once the state's only supermax prison, but I did not know. Unless I was mistaken, this was housed in the level 2 section. It seemed handy for a variety of recreational activities and are allowed to work in the prison and for Michigan State Industries. Things were never the same after its closure in 2009 eliminating 604 Level V security beds. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near WWSJ. It was clearly Justin F&period; Marzke. My guidebook said it was purchased by Robert D&period; Ditmer and began operating under the new callsign of WRBJ. Passepartout remembered it becoming Joy 1580 playing urban Christian music. We enjoyed program entitled The Michigan Oldies Podcast. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Union School (St. Johns, Michigan). Imagine my surprise to learn it was an educational building located at 205 West Baldwin Street in St&period; Johns! Unless I was mistaken, this was designed by architect Oliver Hidden of the Bay City/Detroit firm Watkins. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a school by the district until 1986?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I said. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at East Ward School. It looked as if it was an educational building located at 106 North Traver Street in St&period; Johns. I could see that it was unusual for its size and its elaborate brickwork. It seemed perfect for adult education classes. Passepartout examined an elaborate decorative scheme with corbelled and paneled bricks. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Stony Creek Bridge. To the best of my knowledge, this was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Passepartout asked me if it was constructed in 1880 to carry what is now Dewitt Road over Stony Creek, but I did not know. We admired the single king post in the center of the span. It seemed quite suitable for roof trusses and bridges. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Steam Railroading Institute. If I remembered correctly, this was adopted to better reflect the organization's goals. Passepartout asked me if it was donated to Michigan State University, but I did not know. We admired the open letter in the State News to rally other rail history buffs. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for the film." said Passepartout. Things changed after Chessie System took over in 1984 and ceased operations at the New Buffalo yard. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Swartz Creek Community Schools. It was clearly charged to the parents of the students with classes held in a log schoolhouse with the first teacher. Passepartout asked me if it was voted on to be built in Ryno and rescinded an equal number of times, but I did not know. Things were different after the 1976 when they joined the Big Nine Conference. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Flint Truck Assembly. I remembered it was built shortly after the end of World War II and was split between Fisher Body and Chevrolet. Passepartout said it was split between Fisher Body and Chevrolet.

Imagine my surprise to learn it was awarded on August 23! I remembered it was partially subsidized. We visited the General Motors Chevrolet Division. We admired the long legacy with the automotive industry. I found and admired the Kettering Entrepreneur Society. It seemed handy for Kettering University's faculty. We took advantage of work areas for eight FIRST teams with room to expand and allow space for as many as 16 teams. Edger explained to us how it had been designed to facilitate communication between the different groups. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"We love Kettering in Flint." said Edger. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to WKUF-LP. As every schoolboy knows, this was managed by GMI student Lewis Middaugh and Friday late-evening DJ. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was ahead of its time in the radio world. Passepartout commented that it didn't require any government licensing. Edger and I admired the range of between 6 and 20 miles. Things changed after his death in a farming accident. We moved on, avoiding its inevitable positive impacts on the university. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Atwood Stadium. Edger told me it was named after Edwin W&period; Atwood. It was clearly elected as the Mayor of the City of Flint in 1920. We joined some tourists who were admiring the famous alum as a coach. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for Michigan Invitational Tournament." said Passepartout. <p class="new">Edger drove us to University of Michigan–Flint. Unless I was mistaken, this was a major factor in the establishment of a branch of the University of Michigan in the city of Flint. I remembered it was named the first dean of the Flint College of the University of Michigan. We visited several fraternities and sororities. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"A branch of the Michigan University at Ann Arbor is to be established in Flint at some future day." said Edger. We moved on, unsure what to make of on campus housing food regulations in 2008. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered Flint Central High School. To the best of my knowledge, this was one of the Flint Community Schools. Passepartout asked me if it was the city's oldest school, but I did not know. Passepartout remarked that it didn't make the final roster. Edger and I enjoyed three productions every year. The mood here changed after Flint Northern High School was built in 1928. We had heard stories of facility-damage in the auditorium and scene shop. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus not too far from Dort Federal Credit Union Event Center. It was clearly named for Bob Perani. I could see that it was a goalie for the Flint Generals from 1969 to 1974. We visited the CIFL expansion team Flint Phantoms for the 2008 season. It seemed a fine spot for trade shows. <h2>Chapter 39</h2><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Holly High School. Unless I was mistaken, this was ranked fourth in the state and ranked third in 2010. We visited Karl Richter Community Center and Holly Area Schools' administrative offices and had. We helped ourselves to secondary education for students living in Holly. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Lake Fenton High School. My guidebook told me it was built in 1956 to replace several one-room schools in Fenton Township. As far as I knew, this was the construction of a separate school building for Kindergarten through 6th grades. The mood here changed after to served Kindergarten through 12th grade. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Fenton High School (Michigan). I could see that it was made to the English wing of the school. I remembered it was first built in the 1890s and was expanded in 1938 and 1949. Passepartout observed that it wasn't in the making until 2014. We visited over 1&comma;200 students. We joined some tourists who were admiring the 8-lane swimming pool. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for football and track and field." said Passepartout. I found and admired an 8-lane swimming pool. We encounted some problems with lack of funds. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bus pulled up at Shiawassee River Heritage Water Trail. It was clearly donated to Headwaters Trails by Saginaw Bay Watershed Initiative Network in 2007. We joined some tourists who were admiring the take out above the Linden Mill Pond Dam and a put in just below it. We ignored the nature of the soils and all of the considerations necessary to make the launch accessible. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Flint Engine South. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was designed to produce the FamZero for the Chevrolet Cruze and Volt models beginning in 2010. Passepartout and I enjoyed inline six cylinder versions of the GM Atlas engine until that engine line was discontinued. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to produce the FamZero for the Chevrolet Cruze and Volt models beginning in 2010. Things changed after that engine line was discontinued. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our bus pulled up at West Saint Clair Street Historic District. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was listed in its own right as a Michigan State Historic Site on May 16. Passepartout said it was funded and built in 1918 by Albert Stephens. Passepartout was unimpressed by a variety of architectural styles. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Currier House (Almont, Michigan). My guidebook told me it was designated as a Michigan State Historic Site on April 5. Passepartout asked me if it was designed in the octagon style, but I did not know. I spent a while examining a wraparound porch. Things changed after selling it to another private owner. <p class="new">We alighted from a bus near WDTR. It looked as if it was the flagship of the Joy-FM network of stations planned by the Czeladas. Passepartout asked me if it was to be the flagship of the Smile FM Praise network, but I did not know. Passepartout commented that it wasn't built before the construction permit expired on August 26. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Lake Orion High School. I recalled it was built in 1893 and served grades K-12. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was constructed that would house K-12 students for the next 30 years. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a Community Education Resource Center?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. Passepartout examined the football field and track. Times certainly changed after permanently being classified as Division 1 or Class A in the 1970s. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at The Palace of Auburn Hills. To the best of my knowledge, this was the home of the Detroit Shock of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). I could see that it was recorded for a Vevo Presents. Passepartout remarked that it didn't have to use public funds. It functioned well as the basis for many other professional sports arenas in North America since its construction. I found and admired the amenities that most NBA teams have sought in new arenas. Things were never the same after Tom Gores purchased majority share in 2011. We entered into conversation with a local resident, who introduced themselves as Rossetti. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Oakland University. I remembered it was co-founded by Matilda Dodge Wilson and John A&period; Hannah. Passepartout asked me if it was initially under the banner of Michigan State University as Michigan State University-Oakland, but I did not know. We visited major research institutes and centers addressing a broad range of interests and industries. Rossetti remembered it becoming known as Oakland University. We admired the official chapter house off-campus. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a training camp for the Detroit Lions in 1989?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. I found and admired the Oakland University Archives. We took advantage of entrepreneurial resources and expertise to support and foster new technology-based and life science businesses. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Rochester Hills, Michigan. I could see that it was James Graham who arrived in 1817. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was now a separate municipality. We admired the total area of 32. We took advantage of the Rochester Hills Public Library which is located in Rochester (The City of Rochester and Oakland Township contract with the City of Rochester Hills for residents' use of the library). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Rochester High School (Michigan). My guidebook claimed it was built on Fourth and Wilcox for $8&comma;000. It was clearly being built and completed in 1970. At this point, Rossetti noticed the time and said they had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at The Palace of Auburn Hills. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Clinton–Kalamazoo Canal. Unless I was mistaken, this was abandoned after being only partially completed. I could see that it was to connect Lake St&period; Clair with Lake Michigan. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a millrace to power watermills that operated until the 1940s?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Sterling Heights, Michigan. Passepartout told me it was 65 years of age or older. To the best of my knowledge, this was 65 years of age or older. We visited two roundabouts. Passepartout and I enjoyed programming (including City Council meetings) and community announcements. I admired the total area of 36. The mood here changed after the 1950s an agricultural area largely devoted to growing rhubarb and other crops sold in Detroit. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teen-age strife in Detroit suburb reflects ethnic conflicts of Yugoslavia's civil war." said Brandon. We encounted some problems with the large Polish population in Sterling Heights. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather was worsening, so we  walked to Great Lakes Sports City Superior Arena and arranged passage on a fishing boat. Some time later, it docked near Great Lakes Sports City Superior Arena and we walked the rest of the way. Brandon told me it was the home of the Motor City Mechanics of the former United Hockey League. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was the host of the 2007 USA Hockey National Championships for the Midget division! <p class="new">We alighted from a bus near De La Salle Collegiate High School. Passepartout asked me if it was located on the east side of Detroit before moving to its current location in Warren, but I did not know. If I remembered correctly, this was redesigned in 2002 for the third time. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Builders of Boys, Makers of Men." said Brandon. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Detroit Arsenal (Warren, Michigan). It was clearly the first manufacturing plant ever built for the mass production of tanks in the United States. Passepartout said it was owned by the U&period;S&period; government until 1996. We enjoyed in the U&period;S&period; overall. Brandon explained to us how it had been designed to survive bombardment by the weapons of the day. <h2>Chapter 40</h2><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Grosse Pointe Yacht Club. Brandon pointed out  points throughout the club. Passepartout asked me if it was founded in 1914 through the efforts of a group of 25 sailing and iceboating enthusiasts, but I did not know. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was designed by Boston architect Guy Lowell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church. Passepartout told me it was previously occupied by a school building. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was designated a parish--only the second in what is now Detroit. At this point, Brandon entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. We couldn't fail to notice the statue of Our Lady of Lourdes, the apparition of 11 February 1858. Passepartout thought the statue should have been wearing a flowing white robe. The sculptor had captured the reference to roses and led to very large churches being built at the sites perfectly. To think that somebody who was gathering firewood with her sister and a friend should have such a statue in Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Harpos Concert Theatre. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was built in 1939 for the Wisper and Westman circuit as the Harper Theatre. Passepartout asked me if it was built for about $290&comma;000 and was designed in Art Moderne style by Charles N&period; Agree, but I did not know. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Alter Road. Passepartout pointed out  the Detroit River and to the southern starting point for Lake St&period; Clair. My guidebook said it was little visible difference between Alter Road. Passepartout observed that it didn't suffer the urban decay which currently plagues much of Detroit. We enjoyed at Universal Media Studios in Los Angeles County. We made full benefit of some contrasts of its own. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Pewabic Pottery. Passepartout asked me if it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1991, but I did not know. I remembered it was founded in 1903 by the artist and teacher Mary Chase Perry Stratton and Horace James Caulkins. We took some time to enjoy the famous iridescent glazes. <p class="new">Moving on, we arrived at Indian Village, Detroit. I remembered it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. I could see that it was treasurer and general manager of Detroit Motor Casting. We admired the number of architecturally-significant homes built in the early 20th century. I spent a few minutes studying many historic homes including that of automotive entrepreneur Henry Leland. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Manoogian Mansion. Passepartout told me it was built in 1928 for $300&comma;000 but the owner lost the home during the Great Depression. I could see that it was the Armenian immigrant's way to thank his adopted hometown. Passepartout observed that it didn't immediately move into the mansion because of city budget issues. I admired the boat house. I spent a few minutes examining three sunrooms facing south and the river. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Detroit Yacht Club. My guidebook claimed it was founded by Detroit sailing enthusiasts in 1868. It was clearly built at a cost of $10&comma;000 (with a further $2&comma;000 for furnishings) in 1891. It seemed quite suitable for hosting small parties. Things were never the same after psychiatrist Dr&period; Leonard Ellison filed a lawsuit. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Belle Isle Park (Michigan). I remembered it was settled by French colonists in the 18th century. It looked as if it was once the estate of General Alexander Macomb. Passepartout observed that it didn't rule out a return in the future. We visited the Belle Isle Aquarium. We admired the active private sailing club also offers swimming and other country club amenities. It seemed quite suitable for occasional public events. I found and admired a Nature Center where visitors were able to traverse wooded trails and view wildlife natural habitats. We made full benefit of year-round educational. Things were different after the early 1900s according to Kerschen family history. We met Eero, a college friend of mine who lived nearby. We moved on, unsure what to make of field conditions at Belle Isle. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Belle Isle Aquarium. It was clearly the oldest continually operating public aquarium in North America when it closed on April 3. My guidebook claimed it was operated by the Detroit Zoological Society prior to the 2005 closure. We visited over 1&comma;500 fish of 146 species. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to MacArthur Bridge (Detroit). I could see that it was later renamed the Douglas MacArthur Bridge after General Douglas MacArthur in 1942. It was clearly restored in 1986 at a cost of $11. It was convenient for Belle Isle. We made full benefit of main access to Belle Isle. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix. As far as I could remember, this was planned to be moved to Belle Isle. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was replaced by a CART event! Passepartout commented that it didn't rule out a return in the future. It seemed handy for the track. We ignored CART remeasuring all circuits in 1997. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to F. J. Brennan Catholic High School. Passepartout told me it was originally named Corpus Christi High School (meaning "the Body of Christ") and was founded in 1953. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the first Catholic co-educational secondary school in Windsor! We admired the enrollment of 631 students. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked not too far from Willistead Manor. To the best of my knowledge, this was commissioned by Edward Chandler Walker. It was clearly amalgamated with Windsor in 1935. Passepartout observed that it didn't care to keep living in the big home alone. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a banquet hall?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. At this point, Eero reluctantly left us, saying that they had business to attend to back at Belle Isle Park (Michigan). <p class="new">We parked near St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church (Windsor, Ontario). Passepartout told me it was the largest congregation by membership within the Presbyterian Church in Canada (PCC). It looked as if it was at that time part of the UPC's Presbytery of London. It functioned well as the council chambers by the municipal government until Windsor constructed its first town hall. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to seat 800. Things were never the same after Windsor constructed its first town hall. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Walkerville Collegiate Institute. Unless I was mistaken, this was formed and the Pipe Band was recognized through competition as the best in the province. I remembered it was recognized through competition as the best in the province. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to W. D. Lowe High School. My guidebook claimed it was a public secondary school in downtown Windsor. As far as I knew, this was renamed to W&period; D&period; Lowe in the 1940s after a former principal of the school. Passepartout remembered it becoming the "Trojans". Passepartout and I enjoyed many top ranking professional athletes. The mood here changed after the 70's&period; With the closure of Paterson Collegiate. We noted open in 2010. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Windsor Public Library. I could see that it was located in Lambie's Hall in the building that now stands as the former Windsor Star building. If I remembered correctly, this was inadequate for the people of Windsor. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't a large enough budget and in June and July 1902. Passepartout remembered it becoming clear that $20&comma;000 was not a large enough budget and in June and July 1902. We agreed it was up to date and would have the means to accommodate the people of Windsor. We moved on, disappointed by its vast collection of materials. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Windsor Assembly. Passepartout asked me if it was equipped with an optional V6 engine and in a new long wheel-base version, but I did not know. It looked as if it was produced until July 2007. Passepartout observed that it didn't agree to lower labor costs. We enjoyed until July 2007. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Jackson Park (Windsor). I could see that it was named after former Windsor mayor Cecil E&period; Jackson. I spent a few minutes examining many war memorials including a World War II. We took advantage of a wide assortment of creative play units. We moved on, avoiding the effect that over four decades of exposure to the elements was having on it. <h2>Chapter 41</h2><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Blue Heron Lake. My guidebook claimed it was a turtle slightly larger. Passepartout said it was connected with the Ganatchio Trail in July 2006. We admired the maximum depth of 8 m&period; Blue Heron Lake was connected with the Ganatchio Trail in July 2006. It seemed quite suitable for ice skating or to play hockey. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Forest Glade, Windsor. I could see that it was built in stages throughout the 1960s. We visited the furthest-East sections of Transit Windsors 1C. I admired the estimated population of 25&comma;000 people. Passepartout took notes on the planned community. It was convenient for E&period;C&period; Row Expressway and is home to the furthest-East sections of Transit Windsors 1C. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bus pulled up at Chrysler Canada Greenway. Passepartout told me it was built by Hiram Walker in 1848. If I remembered correctly, this was donated to the Essex Region Conservation Authority in 1993. We admired the unofficial "extension" which continues 2 km straight to its terminus with North Talbot Road. We took advantage of a rest stop along the Greenway in the town of Kingsville. We noted the dangerously high levels of traffic. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Assumption College School. I could see that it was founded by the Basilian Fathers in 1870 as part of Assumption University. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was at first a private boarding school for male students only! Passepartout remembered it becoming a co-educational secondary school within the Windsor-Essex Catholic District School Board. I admired the current population of approximately 650 students. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to University of Windsor. It was clearly founded by the Basilian Fathers of the priestly teaching Congregation of St&period; Basil. Passepartout said it was one of the largest colleges associated with the University of Western Ontario. We admired the major teaching and research focus on Social Justice issues. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was classrooms?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you ask, I am not so sure." I replied. Passepartout was unimpressed by a food court and the campus bookstore. It was convenient for justice. We made full benefit of open access to thousands of electronic theses. We met Alan, an old friend of Passepartout's who was passing by. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Assumption University (Windsor, Ontario). Passepartout told me it was known as Assumption College until changing its name in 1956. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was one of the largest colleges associated with the University of Western Ontario. We joined some tourists who were admiring the heritage reaching back to 1857 and is the parent of the University of Windsor. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun came out as we approached Ambassador Bridge. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was a destination stop for railroads in the area! It was clearly completed in 1929--1&comma;850 ft. We disagreed as to whether it was built next to the Ambassador Bridge. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for overflow traffic." said Passepartout. It was within convenient distance of Interstate 96 (I-96) and I-75 on the American side and Highway 3 on the Canadian side. We helped ourselves to direct access to Interstate 96 (I-96) and I-75 on the American side and Highway 3 on the Canadian side. Things changed after ventilating equipment failed the next year; work was soon abandoned. We moved on, disappointed by increased security measures. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Tiger Stadium (Detroit). Alan told me it was a stadium located in the Corktown neighborhood of Detroit. My guidebook said it was nicknamed "The Corner" for its location on Michigan Avenue and Trumbull Avenue. Passepartout observed that it didn't vote to give control of the project to the DEGC. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for PAL events only and intends to replace the original field with an artificial playing surface." said Passepartout. Things were different after someone in the Yankees organization said that director Billy Crystal. We moved on, avoiding high costs and the lack of a commitment from the Detroit Tigers baseball franchise. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Alan and I walked to Bennett Park (Detroit). I could see that it was home to the Detroit Tigers. It was clearly renamed the American League in 1900 but was still officially a minor league. Passepartout remarked that it didn't count the "wildcat" bleachers that were built on the rooftops of houses behind the left field fence. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Alan and I walked to MGM Grand Detroit. Imagine my surprise to learn it was acquiring rival casino company Mandalay Resort Group! I remembered it was forced to sell either the MGM Grand Detroit or the MotorCity casino. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Casino Windsor attracts around six million visitors each year and is a key driver of the local economy." said Alan. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Cass Technical High School. It looked as if it was Detroit's only magnet school and the only non-neighborhood enrollment school in Detroit. I could see that it was founded on the third floor of the old Cass Union School in 1907. We enjoyed two CDs and are now working on their third. We admired the curriculum that includes Leadership Lab and Cadet Challenge. <p class="new">Our next stop was Second Baptist Church (Detroit, Michigan). My guidebook claimed it was organized in March 1836 by 13 former slaves who left the First Baptist Church due to discrimination. Imagine my surprise to learn it was Detroit's seventh major church! I spent a while studying three floors. Things changed after they could continue their journey. We ignored discrimination. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Greektown, Detroit. It was clearly listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Imagine my surprise to learn it was first settled in the 1830s by German immigrants! We admired the station at the Greektown Casino on Beaubien Street between Monroe Street and Lafayette Boulevard. At this point, Alan entered a nearby restaurant and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It began to rain as we approached 1300 Lafayette East Cooperative. It was clearly originally designed as the first phase of a two building complex. Imagine my surprise to learn it was developed as the Carlton Apartments! We admired the resident party room and offices. Passepartout was unimpressed by a resident party room and offices. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was converted to co-op ownership - on the initiative of the tenants. We met Gunnar, an old friend and terrible bore who was passing by. We encounted some problems with a declining city population and a mixture of extremely spacious studio to four bedroom apartments. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Washington Boulevard Historic District. It was clearly added to the National Register of Historic Places. If I remembered correctly, this was connected to an existing street. Passepartout was unimpressed by a sharp curve south of Michigan Avenue where it was connected to an existing street. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather improved as we approached Moross House. Passepartout asked me if it was completed in 1848 by brickmaker Christopher Moross; it was one of two built by Moross on the site, but I did not know. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was one of two built by Moross on the site. Things changed after the Detroit Historical Commission purchased it in the 1920s. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Gunnar and I walked to Palms Apartments. Imagine my surprise to learn it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985! If I remembered correctly, this was initially built as a high-class residence between 1901 and 1903 at a cost of about $80&comma;000. Passepartout observed that it wasn't fully developed until Julius Kahn. <p class="new">It was a short walk to Sibley House (Detroit, Michigan). Unless I was very much mistaken, this was one of the first lawyers to live in what was then a small village. I could see that it was then a small village. Passepartout remembered it becoming the parish rectory. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really the Rectory of Christ Church Detroit?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I said. At this point, Gunnar had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at 1300 Lafayette East Cooperative. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Thomas A. Parker House. I recalled it was built as a private residence and is located at 975 East Jefferson Avenue in Detroit. If I remembered correctly, this was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was an artist studio?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Riverwalk Hotel Detroit. It was clearly redeveloped as a boutique luxury hotel located on the Detroit International Riverfront. I could see that it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was remodeled and served as a hotel and residence. We met Albert, an old friend of Passepartout's who had heard about our journey. We avoided loss of the building's historic integrity during the conversion. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Elmwood Cemetery (Detroit, Michigan). To the best of my recollection, this was the first fully integrated cemetery in the Midwest. Passepartout asked me if it was destroyed by fire in 1976, but I did not know. We noted its reception room design. It was handy for the grounds. Albert explained to us how it had been designed to harmonize with the historic architecture. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Albert and I walked to John N. Bagley House. I could see that it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was designed in the French Renaissance Revival style by the Detroit firm Rogers and MacFarlane! I admired the massive gable roof and a tower with conical roof. I spent a few minutes studying multiple surface and window treatment. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Garden Court Apartments (Detroit, Michigan), we approached Joseph Campau House. It was clearly listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was built on land that was originally part of the Joseph Campau farm. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a law office?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at The Whittier (Detroit, Michigan). Passepartout told me it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. To the best of my knowledge, this was constructed as an apartment hotel. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for exclusive upper-class homes." said Passepartout. It was within convenient distance of services typically provided by a hotel. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A fog descended as we approached West Village, Detroit. I remembered it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Passepartout asked me if it was platted around that time, but I did not know. We visited a number of prominent Detroiters including Franz C&period; Kuhn. <p class="new">It was a short walk to Frederick K. Stearns House. I recalled it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Passepartout asked me if it was built for Frederick K&period; Stearns, but I did not know. We admired the gabled roof and stuccoed. At this point, Albert entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Arthur M. Parker House. I recalled it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. I could see that it was designed for Arthur M&period; Parker. I admired the medieval character reinforced by irregular bays. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really the headquarters of the Southeast Michigan Synod - Evangelical Lutheran Church in America?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I said. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Detroit Naval Armory. As far as I knew, this was used as both a training facility and civic event site. Imagine my surprise to learn it was used as a barracks and schoolhouse for Navy diesel and electrical schools! We visited Marines and Sailors of Headquarters and Service Company. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was both a training facility and civic event site?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I said. I tripped over a large array of Depression-era WPA art by artists such as John Tabaczuk. Passepartout recounted how it had been renamed the R&period; Thornton Brodhead Armory. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Grosse Pointe South High School. I could see that it was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its significance in architecture. Passepartout asked me if it was designed to hold 1&comma;100, but I did not know. Passepartout commented that it didn't satisfy educators who thought that a library could be the center of instructional activity. Passepartout remembered it becoming obvious that the Grosse Pointes were in need of a new high school. We admired the ongoing tradition of excellence. It was within convenient distance of the new third floor. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the productions of the "All School Musical" which annually takes place in April and May of the school year!" said Passepartout. He explained to us how it had been designed to hold 1&comma;100. We moved on, disappointed by lack of funds. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Beverly Road Historic District, we approached Christ Church Chapel. As far as I knew, this was intended to be one element of a larger building. Was it one element of a larger building? We thought not. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to be similar to the Chapter House of Wells Cathedral. We encountered a passer-by, who introduced themselves as Minoru. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Grosse Pointe Memorial Church. Passepartout told me it was largely Roman Catholic. I could see that it was being used more heavily as a summer resort for residents of Detroit. I spent a while examining carvings by German sculptor Alois Lang and stained glass windows designed by the Willet Studios. <p class="new">We wandered to Saint Paul Catholic Church (Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan). Passepartout asked me if it was the first Catholic parish in the Grosse Pointes, but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was then a primarily agricultural area along Lake St&period; Clair! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was the parish hall until it was dismantled in 1914?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Minoru gave us a lift to Carl E. and Alice Candler Schmidt House. I could see that it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Passepartout said it was born in Detroit on December 31. It functioned well as a summer cottage and thusly has only one closet on the first floor. Things were different after the latter's death in 1897; soon after. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Charles J. and Ingrid V. (Frendberg) Koebel House. It was clearly listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Passepartout asked me if it was the owner of the Koebel Diamond Tool Company, but I did not know. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to be part of the landscape. We met Pipsan, a college friend of mine who lived nearby. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pipsan gave us a lift to Grosse Pointe Academy. As every schoolboy knows, this was originally a French ribbon farm running from Lake St&period; Clair to Ridge Road. Passepartout said it was built on the property. At this point, Pipsan had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at Charles J. and Ingrid V. (Frendberg) Koebel House. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Rose Terrace (Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan). My guidebook told me it was a private home located at 12 Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Farms. It functioned well as Mrs&period; Dodge's private suite. I found and admired an organ purchased by Horace Dodge for the original Rose Terrace. <h2>Chapter 42</h2><p class="new">We parked near Chatham Memorial Arena. Passepartout asked me if it was built in 1949 on the grounds of a training area used by the Canadian Forces during World War II, but I did not know. He said it was retired after Wiseman left Chatham to play for the University of Michigan Wolverines. We thought it was coupled with a second ice surface. We moved on, avoiding concussion problems. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Ursuline College (Chatham). My guidebook told me it was founded by the Ursuline Sisters as a girls-only school in 1865. Passepartout said it was run by the Ursuline Sisters until the late 20th century. Passepartout remarked that it didn't put a musical out. Passepartout remembered it becoming a coed school. We admired the computer lab and at least one washroom for each gender. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for some sacraments." said Passepartout. He examined the recently re-built theater. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the impressive Drama Department!" said Passepartout. Things changed after the 2009 season when they lost in the first round of the play-offs to the Wallaceburg Tartans. We met Colin, an old friend of Passepartout's who lived nearby. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Reuben Wright House. It was clearly apparently built in the early 1830s and it is one of the earliest extant structures in the area. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983! Passepartout said it was believed to have been built in the early 1830s and it is one of the earliest extant structures in the area. At this point, Colin noticed the time and said they had to leave, saying that they had to return to Ursuline College (Chatham). <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near State University of New York at Fredonia. Passepartout talked about  a fifth story. I recalled it was one of the state teachers' colleges traditionally specializing in music education. Passepartout said it was designed by prominent architects I&period;M&period; Pei and Henry N&period; Cobb in 1968. We visited the School of Music and was named after American music education pioneer Lowell Mason. We enjoyed by a team of Fredonia students. We admired its global reputation for excellence in the design. I admired the sister station WDVL which broadcasts via internet streaming and a local cable channel. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a sports center with a basketball court?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I said. Passepartout was unimpressed by the Department of Theatre and Dance. It was within convenient distance of information in support of the curricular needs of SUNY Fredonia's students and faculty. We helped ourselves to seating for over 850 readers. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to be riot-proof. We traversed the floor. We avoided state funding difficulties throughout much of the 1970s. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Fredonia High School (New York). It was clearly not enough room for the large incoming classes. Imagine my surprise to learn it was called The Hilltopper which has led people to believe that this was actually the school mascot! Passepartout examined the entire school district until there was not enough room for the large incoming classes. Things were different after there was not enough room for the large incoming classes. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Fredonia Opera House. Unless I was mistaken, this was replaced by the current tin ceiling. Passepartout asked me if it was gradually replaced by electric, but I did not know. We enjoyed with relatively inexpensive and readily available materials. It was convenient for performing arts and other events formerly available only in major cities. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Zoar, New York. Imagine my surprise to learn it was first inhabited during the Stone Age by Algonquian American Indians who were a nomadic people! As far as I knew, this was a station in the Underground Railroad. We avoided a proposed mining expansion by the companies on the site. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Old Sardinia Town Hall. It looked as if it was built between 1828 and 1830. Unless I was mistaken, this was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Passepartout examined a Baptist church congregation. Things changed after deeded to the town of Sardinia in 1945 for use as a town hall. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Area code 716. Passepartout told me it was one of the original set of area codes issued in October 1947. He asked me if it was created by splitting 716 and area code 315, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for the western corner of New York." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bus pulled up at WIVB-TV. Imagine my amazement to learn it was originally owned by the Butler family! Unless I was mistaken, this was a short visit to the North Pole with Santa Claus and Forgetful the Elf. Passepartout commented that it wasn't included in the agreement. I admired the strong news tradition. Our visit was cut short due to the length of the match. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to WTSS. Imagine my surprise to learn it was first used by WBEN-FM in the 1950s when the station moved to that frequency from 106! Unless I was mistaken, this was heard on other stations in Upstate New York during this period. Passepartout observed that it didn't have a classic hits outlet in the city. Passepartout and I admired the transmitter in Colden. <h2>Chapter 43</h2><p class="new">We parked near Chestnut Ridge Park. My guidebook claimed it was acquired by Erie County in 1926. I remembered it was one of the first parks established by the county. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for firefighter training is located on the premises." said Passepartout. We helped ourselves to an amphitheater-like setting. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Ralph Wilson Stadium. It looked as if it was renamed in 1998 for team founder and then-owner Ralph Wilson (1918-2014). Passepartout remarked that it wasn't wanted to be close to Lancaster High School. We enjoyed by a Western New York company. Things were different after they were defeated in 1996 by the Jacksonville Jaguars on December 28. We met Frank, a college friend of mine who was in the area. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coffee Rich Park." said Frank. We moved on, avoiding the death of lead singer Robert Plant's son. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near WGR. If I remembered correctly, this was never reissued to another ship and reverted to a pool of available call signs for new radio stations. I could see that it was named "WGR" after George Rand (founder of Remington Rand). I admired the power of 5&comma;000 watts. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was spun off to new owners. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Woodlawn Beach State Park. Passepartout asked me if it was historically a popular swimming location and resort during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but I did not know. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was restricted after the 1950s. Things were never the same after dusk seven days a week beginning Memorial Day weekend and closes Labor Day weekend. At this point, Frank entered a nearby restaurant and bade us farewell. We avoided state budget constraints. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Saint Francis High School (Athol Springs, New York). It looked as if it was founded in 1927 by Fr. Imagine my surprise to learn it was purchased in 1916 by Father Hyacinth Fudzinski! We enjoyed a number of men who now serve in a variety of positions within the NFL. We admired the long history. It seemed a fine spot for residence life. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway Station (Orchard Park, New York). My guidebook claimed it was acquired by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. I remembered it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. We met Henry, an old friend and terrible bore who lived nearby. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a coach near West Seneca East Senior High School. Unless I was mistaken, this was paramount due to the use of split sessions - one in the morning and one in the afternoon. It was clearly a member of the National Inventors Hall of Fame and a recipient of the Lemelson-MIT Prize. We moved on, avoiding the use of split sessions - one in the morning and one in the afternoon. <p class="new">I remembered Buffalo Creek Reservation. Henry told me it was a tract of land surrounding Buffalo Creek in the central portion of Erie County. Passepartout asked me if it was conquered by the Senecas in the 1600s from the Wenrohronon, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for economic development." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down not too far from Miller-Mackey House. Passepartout told me it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a recreational and social facility for the area's young people?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I said. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  walked to Buffalo-Lancaster Regional Airport and arranged passage on a boat. Some time later, it docked near Lancaster District School No. 6 and we walked the rest of the way. It looked as if it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Darien Lake. I could see that it was used as a popular swimming destination for many years. I remembered it was a pair of water slides over the lake called Hydro Force. Henry and I admired the full capacity of 21&comma;600. It functioned well as a popular swimming destination for many years. It was convenient for the park for the duration of their stay. We encounted some problems with his physical condition. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky darkened as we approached Hoot N Holler. I could see that it was the first roller coaster at the park. It looked as if it was originally called Ladybug for its ladybug shaped trains. We joined some tourists who were admiring the sea green track and supports and a single brown train themed as an owl. Things were different after it was moved to its new location and renamed in 1997. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to spare, we walked to Batman The Escape. My guidebook claimed it was designed by Intamin and featured one loop. Things were different after September 1992 (where it was known as Shockwave); and Six Flags AstroWorld from 1994 until 2005. We moved on, avoiding the positions of the restraints. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Moto Coaster (Darien Lake). To the best of my knowledge, this was constructed around the same time and is currently operating at Knott's Berry Farm. Passepartout said it was used for tuning and testing at Zamperla's factory in Italy. It seemed perfect for tuning and testing at Zamperla's factory in Italy. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Mount Pleasant (Indian Falls, New York). It looked as if it was established in the mid-19th century. As far as I knew, this was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Henry and I admired the total of eight contributing resources. It seemed perfect for fields and houses clustered along the road. <h2>Chapter 44</h2><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near WGCC-FM. I recalled it was the headlining band for Rockfest. I could see that it was a hopeful for Rockfest 2006 was Kittie. We joined some tourists who were admiring the Height Above Average Terrain (HAAT) of 50 meters. We avoided a previously scheduled touring event. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Holland Land Office. Passepartout asked me if it was the third and last office of the Holland Land Company, but I did not know. I recalled it was declared a National Historic Landmark. I admired the overhanging eave with a continuation of the denticulation on the pediment. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was exhibit space?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. We avoided financial troubles in some of his other land dealings. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Batavia Downs. I recalled it was wagered on the first card. Passepartout asked me if it was cancelled in 1942 and 1943 because of war travel restrictions, but I did not know. Things were never the same after the 2007 season when Mr&period;Zambito took over. At this point, Henry entered a nearby bar and bade us farewell. Our visit was cut short due to a contract dispute with horseman. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Batavia Club. Passepartout talked about  it from the north. If I remembered correctly, this was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Passepartout said it was the headquarters of the Holland Land Company. Passepartout remembered it becoming the Seymour Place facility of GO ART!. We joined some tourists who were admiring the wooden fence with wide square recessed-paneled columns. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Richmond Memorial Library. It looked as if it was strongly inspired by several libraries in Massachusetts that Richardson himself had recently built. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was commissioned by local philanthropist Mary E&period; Richmond! Passepartout and I admired the similar set of round-arched windows in its apex. It was convenient for resources and services that meet the educational. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Genesee County Courthouse. Unless I was mistaken, this was at that time the entire Holland Purchase. I could see that it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for some court purposes as well as offices for the county manager." said Passepartout. I spent a while examining one other building. We ignored its location at the convergence of major Iroquois trails through the region. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Genesee County Courthouse Historic District. Unless I was mistaken, this was subdivided and settled in the early 19th century. Passepartout asked me if it was recognized as a historic district, but I did not know. Passepartout remembered it becoming settled and developed. It functioned well as a historical museum. Passepartout looked up at the statue of Emory Upton, a United States Army General and military strategist. The sculptor had captured the tremendous effect on the U&period;S&period; Army when it was published posthumously in 1904 perfectly. To think that somebody who was wounded in the arm and left side during the action at Blackburn's Ford should have such a statue in Genesee County Courthouse Historic District. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a coach near Genesee Country Village and Museum. Passepartout told me it was conceived and founded by John (Jack) L&period; Wehle in 1966. I could see that it was a collector of art and recognized that another art form. We visited a tally keeper and announcer. Passepartout and I swapped stories about both Morrie Silver. We thought it was displayed in appropriate cultural context. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Marion Steam Shovel (Le Roy, New York). It looked as if it was moved to its current site in the mid-20th century. I could see that it was time to move the shovel he took care of that as well. Passepartout remembered it becoming the first steam shovel listed on the National Register of Historic Places. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Le Roy House and Union Free School. Passepartout talked about  the basement. As far as I knew, this was originally a land office. Imagine my surprise to learn it was subdivided into a boardinghouse for faculty and students at Ingham and the Le Roy Academic Institute! Passepartout remembered it becoming the local historical museum. We admired the classical entablature. It functioned well as a factory for the manufacture of patent medicines. Passepartout was unimpressed by the original circular stairway. It seemed handy for three rooms of nearly equal size. We took advantage of light; the corresponding opening on the east has been bricked in. Things were different after a local historical society was organized. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Stafford Village Four Corners Historic District. Passepartout pointed out  Morganville a short distance to the north. Passepartout told me it was the first European settlement on the Holland Purchase. It was clearly later converted to town hall. We admired the molded architrave with keystone. It functioned well as a parish house. We helped ourselves to the entrance to this clapboard-sided one-story Greek Revival house built in 1831. <h2>Chapter 45</h2><p class="new">We alighted from a coach near Clark-Keith House. Unless I was mistaken, this was built about 1827 and has housed a tavern. I recalled it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a residence?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Caledonia House Hotel. I could see that it was constructed in 1831-1833 of cut stone in the Federal style. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 13! We admired the -story. It functioned well as such through the 19th century. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Scottsville Free Library. My guidebook claimed it was by private printing of three hundred fifty copies in Scottsville. It was clearly founded to support and manage the library also thrived. Passepartout commented that it didn't last; interest in it diminished. We visited the Scottsville post office. It was convenient for the resources of all of the county's libraries. We took advantage of governance of the association. The mood here changed after its purchase by Carpenter in 1820. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost, we  doubled back to New York Museum of Transportation and arranged passage on the next boat. Some time later, it docked near New York Museum of Transportation and we walked the rest of the way. As far as I knew, this was finally sold for scrap in 1950. I could see that it was donated to the Rochester Chapter. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for freight service by both Penn Central and the Baltimore & Ohio railroads under contract." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Rochester Institute of Technology. Passepartout told me it was called Rochester Athenæum and Mechanics Institute (RAMI). I remembered it was originally located in the Bevier Memorial Building. Passepartout remarked that it didn't obtain ABET accreditation until 2003. We visited a number of somewhat rare plant species. We admired the wide variety of club. It functioned well as a school mascot. We helped ourselves to most of its budget to student research endeavors. We took some time to enjoy the legendary fine arts. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Nazareth College (New York). Imagine my amazement to learn it was composed of 25 young women who began their studies in a large mansion on Lake Avenue in Rochester! Passepartout commented that it didn't occur at Nazareth (Source: College Archives Committee). We joined some tourists who were admiring the strong reputation in the Rochester area for community service. It seemed a fine spot for academic and administrative purposes. We helped ourselves to important learning facilities for students in health and human services programs. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was St. John Fisher College. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was made possible by a $5 million gift from the late Robert Wegman. As far as I knew, this was led for 34 seasons by Phil Kahler. We visited Fisher's football. We made full benefit of tutoring and small group instruction in literacy for elementary through high school students. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near The Harley School. Donald told me it was intended to be democratic. It was clearly initially opened on Oxford Street in the city of Rochester. We admired the considerable number of clubs. Passepartout examined an indoor swimming pool. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"THE LEGACY OF HARRIET BENTLEY (1885-1918), FOUNDER OF THE HARLEY SCHOOL." said Donald. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Penfield High School. Passepartout told me it was the Penfield Seminary. I remembered it was built to accommodate 150 students. I admired the enrollment of 500 students. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a public school until 1907?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I replied. I tripped over the district's only elementary school. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to First Baptist Church of Fairport and booked ourselves onto a private plane, alighting near First Baptist Church of Fairport. Imagine my surprise to learn it was raised to help rebuild the church instead! Unless I was very much mistaken, this was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. I admired the large square corner tower topped by a tall narrow spire. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Adolph Lomb House. Passepartout told me it was built in 1907 of poured concrete faced in brick. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was built as the focal point of a large farm / summer estate for Adolph Lomb.

At this point, Donald hailed a cab, saying that they had business to attend to back at Monroe Golf Club. <h2>Chapter 46</h2><p class="new">We alighted from a coach near Palmyra-Macedon High School. If I remembered correctly, this was the Red Devils until 1961. My guidebook claimed it was the first state championship by a Pal-Mac sports team. I admired the history of high performance in NYSSMA Festivals. We made full benefit of education for grades nine through twelve with classes administered by 50 full-time teachers. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to East Main Street Commercial Historic District (Palmyra, New York). My guidebook claimed it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. I remembered it was included in the Palmyra Village Historic District. I spent a while examining two blocks of solid. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by was Book of Mormon Historic Publication Site. I remembered it was located in the western most building of a complex originally known as Thayer and Grandin Brick Row. As far as I knew, this was the older brother of E&period; B&period; Grandin. Passepartout said that he wasn't the sort that he had hoped for. It was within convenient distance of FamilySearch databases were set up in the building to allow visitors to research their genealogy. Times certainly changed after he received a USD $3&comma;000 security payment. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout told me about Smith Family Farm. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was the boyhood home of Joseph Smith. It looked as if it was purchased by the LDS Church in 1907 and passed into its care in 1916. Passepartout commented that it didn't enter a purchase agreement for the land until a land agent had been appointed in 1820. Things were never the same after a land agent had been appointed in 1820. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Roe Cobblestone Schoolhouse. My guidebook told me it was built about 1820 and is constructed of irregularly shaped. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a single family residence?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I said. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near NBT Bank Stadium. Imagine my amazement to learn it was removed and replaced with natural grass! It was clearly scheduled to perform at the stadium. We visited the Syracuse Chiefs. We admired the official seating capacity of 11&comma;071 people. We noted drainage problems at their home park. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Northside, Syracuse. It was clearly originally a German neighborhood. Passepartout asked me if it was used as a cemetery until it was dedicated for park purposes in 1839, but I did not know. We visited several athletic fields and courts including a softball diamond and a hardball diamond. We admired the pool that is 165 ft long by 75 ft wide with ten lanes. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a cemetery until it was dedicated for park purposes in 1839?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. Things were different after it was dedicated for park purposes in 1839. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Grace Episcopal Church (Syracuse, New York). Unless I was very much mistaken, this was designed by Horatio Nelson White and was built in 1876. I remembered it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. I admired the long history of social activism. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Syracuse University. I could see that it was founded in 1831 by the Genesee Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Lima. My guidebook claimed it was resolved to enlarge the institution from a seminary into a college. We visited the SU Art Galleries. We enjoyed alumni in many fields of broadcasting. I admired the contemporary art space that commissions. I found and admired the first College of Fine Arts in the United States. It was within convenient distance of libraries. We took advantage of emergency and non-emergency services 24 hours a day. We admired the famous sports staff. Things changed after it split to become its own recognized student organization in 2004. We noted the city's attractive transportation hub. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. Unless I was mistaken, this was dedicated on October 3. I remembered it was the first program to offer a graduate professional degree in public administration. I tripped over the present-day Maxwell School. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Carrier Dome. My guidebook told me it was under pressure to improve its football facilities in order to remain a Division I-A football school. Passepartout asked me if it was 70 years old and not up to the standards of other schools, but I did not know. We visited the Syracuse Orange football. We enjoyed to echo many times. We avoided fire codes. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. It looked as if it was established in 1911 through a bill signed by New York Governor John Alden Dix. Unless I was mistaken, this was elected president of the college's Board of Trustees at its first meeting. We visited the Department of Environmental Resources Engineering and the Division of Environmental Science. Passepartout and I admired the full-scale laboratory for materials science testing. It functioned well as an insult. It was convenient for library resources. <p class="new">Passepartout and I walked to Archbold Gymnasium. If I remembered correctly, this was built in 1908 with money donated by John Dustin Archbold. I could see that it was due to a large fire which gutted most of the building. I found and admired the school's ROTC programs. The mood here changed after the building of the Manley Field House in 1962. We avoided a large fire which gutted most of the building. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Christian Brothers Academy (DeWitt, New York).

We made full benefit of teaching and research space for use by faculty and students in the science and health professions. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eric Dolphy Barbecue." said Ward. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Ward and I hitched a lift to Shoppingtown Mall. If I remembered correctly, this was one of Syracuse's first suburban shopping centers. I could see that it was enclosed in 1975 and substantially remodeled in 1991. Passepartout and I admired the food court and a fourteen-screen Regal Cinemas movie theater. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why county taxpayers are forced to refund $2." said Ward. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Manlius Pebble Hill School. It looked as if it was founded in 1869 in Manlius. My guidebook said it was reorganized as the St&period; John's Military School. Passepartout remarked that it didn't escape this trend. Passepartout remembered it becoming impractical to run two campuses. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for the Lower School and Middle School and the Manlius campus used for the Upper School." said Passepartout. I found and admired the school's administrative offices. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"To inspire our students to think critically, act responsibly, and develop a passion for life long learning." said Ward. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked not too far from Nottingham High School (Syracuse, New York). Ward told me it was named for the prominent Syracuse attorney William Nottingham (1853-1921). Imagine my astonishment to learn it was built connecting the former George Washington Elementary School to the main building! We admired the enrollment of about 1200 students in grades 9-12. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the math classrooms and art classrooms. <p class="new">Our coach pulled up at WSKO (AM). It looked as if it was the most popular Top 40-format station in the area during the 1960s. I remembered it was character actor and Golden Globe nominee Aldo Ray. Passepartout and I enjoyed on a station tribute website. Times certainly changed after WTKW acquired the rights in 2007. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus not too far from Wellington House (Fayetteville, New York). To the best of my recollection, this was built in 1922 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Passepartout said it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. We met Ward, a college friend of mine who was in the area. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Ward and I hitched a lift to High Bridge, New York. Imagine my amazement to learn it was founded around 1833 but was defunct less than a century later! Passepartout said it was defunct less than a century later. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't built until 1895 and lasted just two years. Things were different after the nearby lime mines gave out in the early 1900s. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down not too far from Green Lakes State Park. Passepartout told us a long story about  a video interview with Rocky Kelly. It was clearly designed by Robert Trent Jones in 1935. Passepartout said it was one of Trent Jones' earliest; ultimately. Passepartout remembered it becoming the Fayetteville Camp for German prisoners of war. We admired the "masterpiece" Dodson. I spent a while examining a heavy load of dissolved minerals that are not present in water that enters through the surface from rain and snow. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"When walking on the lake trails, one is cradled between the rich, vibrant, almost alien blue-green waters on one side and thickly vegetated, steep wooded inclines on the other." said Ward. We avoided the photosynthetic activity of cyanobacterial picoplankton. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Fayetteville–Manlius High School. I could see that it was also opened directly next to the high school in 1965. I remembered it was expanded and equipped with state-of-the-art equipment in 2008. We admired the 100 grade point scale. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guarded by the old oak tree." said Ward. We moved on, unsure what to make of controversial policies implemented at school-sponsored dances. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Lipe Art Park. My guidebook told me it was to use an urban vacant lot as a space for creative activity for the community. I recalled it was named after a local inventor and businessman. At this point, Ward entered a nearby shop and bade us farewell. <h2>Chapter 47</h2><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Chittenango ovate amber snail. It was clearly reported three years later as a subspecies of the oval ambersnail. Passepartout asked me if it was finally judged to be a distinct species Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, but I did not know. Passepartout commented that it wasn't surveyed again until 1954. We moved on, disappointed by external morphological differences (color and shell shape). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Cazenovia College. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was sponsored by the Methodist Church but was a non-sectarian institution. As far as I knew, this was a non-sectarian institution. Passepartout commented that it didn't officially adopt the name Cazenovia Seminary until 1894. Passepartout remembered it becoming a college. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Colonel and I hitched a lift to Stone Quarry Hill Art Park. Colonel told me it was established in 1793 by John Linklaen. Unless I was mistaken, this was the site of the early 19th century farm of Mary Hackley. Colonel remembered it becoming an official venue in 1991 and is one of the first art parks to be established in the United States. At this point, Colonel entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Peterboro Land Office. My guidebook told me it was constructed of locally produced brick laid in Flemish bond on the facade and common bond elsewhere. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was used for that purpose until the late 19th century. Passepartout and I enjoyed brick laid in Flemish bond on the facade and common bond elsewhere. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for that purpose until the late 19th century." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a coach near Fenner Wind Farm. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was unlikely another turbine would fall! To the best of my knowledge, this was shut down while the accident was investigated. Passepartout and I enjoyed at the farm provides electricity for more than 7&comma;800 houses. We helped ourselves to electricity for more than 7&comma;800 houses. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Notleymere. Passepartout asked me if it was designed by architect Robert W&period; Gibson, but I did not know. He said it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a private family residence?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Near here was the site of Chenango Canal. Passepartout asked me if it was a towpath canal built and operated in the mid-19th century in Upstate New York in the United States, but I did not know. I recalled it was 97 miles long and for much of its course followed the Chenango River. Passepartout observed that it wasn't yet a scientific discipline. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for the supply of the canal." said Passepartout. He took a photograph of the fare on a packet line that ran between Norwich and Binghamton. I spent some time examining three contributing structures. It was convenient for their markets. Passepartout mourned it having been filled in. We moved on, unsure what to make of the often prohibitively high repair costs. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Colgate University. I recalled it was founded by thirteen men (six clergymen and seven laymen). Imagine my astonishment to learn it was halted by legal action! Passepartout observed that it wasn't invited to the 1933 Rose Bowl. Were there five or six fraternities? Passepartout didn't seem to care. We admired the impressive 11&comma;000 some art objects that are soon to be moved to a brand new facility. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for lectures." said Passepartout. He examined an impressive 11&comma;000 some art objects that are soon to be moved to a brand new facility. We made full benefit of organic rice. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was derecognized. Times certainly changed after the fall semester of their sophomore year. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Andy Kerr Stadium. Imagine my surprise to learn it was dedicated in honor of former Colgate football coach Andy Kerr in September 1966! My guidebook said it was constructed behind the west stands of the stadium. We visited the Colgate University Raiders football and men's lacrosse teams. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at WRCU-FM. I remembered it was formed by students who were interested in communications. Passepartout asked me if it was expanded over the Hamilton community by broadcasting over the town's power lines, but I did not know. We admired the large variety of specialty show formats. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Adon Smith House. Passepartout told me it was built about 1850 and is a -story brick dwelling with Italianate elements. If I remembered correctly, this was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. We admired the glazed belvedere. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was the village office building?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Old Biology Hall. It looked as if it was built in 1884 and is a two story stone building with brick trim measuring 40 feet by 70 feet. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was built at the end of the Colgate quadrangle for the biological sciences. It functioned well as an art studio in the 1970s. <h2>Chapter 48</h2><p class="new">Our train arrived near Moss Island. I remembered it was subject to massive heat and pressure. To the best of my knowledge, this was planning to build a bridge over Moss Island. We joined some tourists who were admiring the adjacent road and spans about ¾ of the island. It seemed handy for disabled fishermen. We took advantage of access to disabled fishermen. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! The extremely large (40-50 ft) potholes as well as being popular with local rock climbers!" said Passepartout. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Reformed Dutch Church of Stone Arabia. Passepartout told me it was built about 1787 and is a simple rectangular building constructed of cut limestone blocks. If I remembered correctly, this was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. We admired the somewhat flattened gable roof and a belfry. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Trinity Lutheran Church and Cemetery (Stone Arabia, New York). My guidebook claimed it was burned to the ground by British forces led by Sir William Johnson during the October 19. As far as I knew, this was established in the early 18th century and contains approximately 25 burials. I spent some time examining approximately 25 burials. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus not too far from Van Alstyne House. Unless I was mistaken, this was built about 1730 and has three rooms with a garrett under the roof. Passepartout asked me if it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, but I did not know. I tripped over the Rufus Grider collection of historically accurate drawings documenting 18th century homes. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Canajoharie. To the best of my knowledge, this was the name of one of two major towns of the Mohawk nation in the eighteenth century. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the home of the notable Mohawk leaders Hendrick Theyanoguin (1692-1755) and the Brants! Passepartout examined the Indian Castle Church. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived not too far from Walrath-Van Horne House. Passepartout asked me if it was built in 1842 and was originally a -story Greek Revival stone house with a full-height portico, but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was originally a -story Greek Revival stone house with a full-height portico! I admired the Second Empire style. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">The weather was worsening, so we  made our way to Amsterdam (Amtrak station) and caught the next train, alighting near Guy Park. Passepartout told me it was appointed by the Crown to succeed him as British Superintendent for Indian Affairs. Unless I was mistaken, this was built in 1774 of limestone in the Georgian architectural style. It seemed quite suitable for years in the early nineteenth century as a tavern and stagecoach stop. It seemed handy for water transportation. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Chalmers Knitting Mills. It was clearly built in 1913 and expanded in 1916. Passepartout asked me if it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010, but I did not know. Passepartout and I enjoyed undergarments and remained in operation under the Chalmers name until the founders death in 1959. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory. Imagine my amazement to learn it was converted to a Naval Nuclear Propulsion project! Passepartout asked me if it was declared to be complete by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection in October 2006, but I did not know. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near New York City Hall. Imagine my surprise to learn it was built by the Dutch in the 17th century near 73 Pearl Street! Unless I was very much mistaken, this was awarded to Joseph-François Mangin and John McComb. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't dedicated until 1811. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a turning loop for ?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. It seemed handy for the building is restricted to tours and to those with specific business appointments. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to be the showpiece of the new subway. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by was University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh. Imagine my amazement to learn it was the first state normal school in the United States to have a kindergarten! I could see that it was called Oshkosh State Teachers College from 1927 to 1951. We admired the radio station. It was hard to believe it was ever a lab school where student teachers taught kindergarten through ninth grade students. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the Center for Economic Education. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to be one of the most energy efficient buildings in the state. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With some urgency, we walked to Park Row (BMT station). Passepartout asked me if it was a major elevated railway terminal constructed over the New York end of the Brooklyn Bridge, but I did not know. I could see that it was the only Manhattan station available for elevated trains from Brooklyn. Passepartout remarked that it didn't use the Park Row terminal. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was 1 Police Plaza. Passepartout told me it was featured in establishing shots. He asked me if it was a made-for-TV movie which aired in 1986, but I did not know. Passepartout observed that it didn't add any new floors to the building or any new employees to police headquarters. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I walked to Murry Bergtraum High School. Passepartout talked about  only half of the school building having windows. It was clearly one of the first business-themed high schools in New York City. Passepartout said it was also exempted from chancellor Joel Klein's citywide uniform curriculum initiated in 2003. We took advantage of its students with what is called "dual preparation". We admired the legendary girls' basketball team. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to accommodate. We moved on, disappointed by its large. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Hamilton-Madison House. It was clearly raised for the endowment fund. It looked as if it was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. We took advantage of a culturally sensitive environment. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to serve public health needs of newly arrived Italian immigrants. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Two Bridges, Manhattan. Unless I was mistaken, this was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in September 2003. Passepartout said it was based in the Two Bridges neighborhood. Passepartout remembered it becoming fully part of Chinatown. We admired the statue of Lin Zexu, a Chinese scholar and official of the Qing dynasty. We were impressed that somebody who was already "unusually brilliant" should have such a statue in Two Bridges, Manhattan. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Knickerbocker Village. Imagine my amazement to learn it was the first apartment development in the United States to receive federal funding! My guidebook said it was reduced by two-thirds to bring the monthly room rental down to the $12. We visited a very diverse group of tenants that included civil servants. <p class="new">Passepartout and I walked to East Broadway (IND Sixth Avenue Line). Passepartout talked about  an intermediate level. Passepartout told me it was supposed to be a station of the unbuilt IND Worth Street Line. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was space for maintenance?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I said. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Cooperative Village. It was clearly the second cooperative sponsored by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. Passepartout asked me if it was completed in 1930 at the site of a former printing plant, but I did not know. Passepartout observed that it didn't turn up any major design flaws. Did it provide direct sunlight to all rooms? We were not sure. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! The murals by Hugo Gellert in a socialist realist style!" said Passepartout. We met George, an old colleague of mine who was passing by. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free." said George. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Henry Street Settlement, we approached Bialystoker Synagogue. Passepartout talked about  a ladder going up to an attic. Passepartout told me it was designated a New York City Landmark in 1966. I remembered it was first organized in 1865 on Manhattan's Lower East Side as the Chevra Anshei Chesed of Bialystok. We visited an Orthodox Jewish congregation. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a synagogue in New York City?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, George and I hitched a lift to Brooklyn Brewery. Passepartout asked me if it was started in 1987 by Steve Hindy and Tom Potter, but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was brewed by contract by Matt Brewing Company! We ignored the limited ability to meet demand at the Williamsburg brewery. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked a short distance to McCarren Park. Imagine my surprise to learn it was renamed McCarren Park in 1909 after State Senator Patrick H&period; McCarren (1849-1909)! My guidebook claimed it was resurfaced and has been a popular destination for running enthusiasts. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a large concert venue?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I replied. Things changed after the community came to a consensus plan in 2001. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to Bard High School Early College. My guidebook told me it was the first school in the Gates Foundation's Early College High School Initiative. Passepartout asked me if it was opened in November 2004, but I did not know. We joined some tourists who were admiring the similar philosophy to BHSEC Manhattan. It functioned well as a classroom. We moved on, avoiding the construction of an elevator. <p class="new">It was a short walk to Saint Cecilia's Catholic Church (Brooklyn). It was clearly placed beside the new church and converted to a lyceum/gymnasium. Unless I was mistaken, this was solemnly consecrated 1901. We joined some tourists who were admiring the painting of Saint Cecilia. It seemed perfect for the construction is limestone. We ignored the Vatican's reformed rules to bring baptisms closer to the church community. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was McGolrick Park. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was acquired by the city in 1889 and the park was open by 1891. I remembered it was originally called Winthrop Park after an assemblyman. Passepartout and I swapped stories about the Battle of the Monitor and Merrimack. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Nassau Avenue (IND Crosstown Line). George pointed out  two staircases going up to either western corners of Manhattan and Nassau Avenues. My guidebook claimed it was used in regular service until July 1. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the line's southern terminus! <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Park Row (BMT station) and caught the next train, alighting near DeKalb Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line). George talked about  either southern corners. As far as I knew, this was the western end of the already-operating elevated line to Canarsie. I admired the single staircase from each platform. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Jefferson Street (BMT Canarsie Line). Passepartout told me it was the western end of the already-operating elevated line to Canarsie. As far as I knew, this was installed at the Canarsie-bound platform in the summer of 2000. We took advantage of entrance/exit from the station. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"JEFFERSON ST." said George. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed the site of Arbitration Rock. I recalled it was set in 1769 as the boundary marker between the two Long Island townships of Newtown and Bushwick. It was clearly in Queens County and Bushwick in Kings County. Passepartout observed that it wasn't settled until 1880. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The feeling ran so high than men of one community would stone those of another." said George. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Fresh Pond Road (BMT Myrtle Avenue Line). It looked as if it was formerly a major transfer point to the Flushing-Ridgewood streetcar Line to Flushing. Unless I was mistaken, this was replaced by the Q58 bus on July 17. We joined some tourists who were admiring the station house below the platform and tracks near the east (railroad south) end. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for storing buses based out of the neighboring Fresh Pond Bus Depot." said Passepartout. It was convenient for and from the station. We took advantage of access to and from the station. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Glendale, Queens. I could see that it was a swampy area of land with fresh water pools. It looked as if it was part of 74&comma;000 acre of land collectively called Newtown. We visited a large and active community of German immigrants. Passepartout and I enjoyed the first atomic bombs. I admired the bucolic. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the graves of Confederate soldiers who died in local prisons and hospitals. At this point, George reluctantly left us, saying that they had business to attend to back at Cooperative Village. We had heard stories of its private right of way. <p class="new">Moving on, we arrived at Leo Frank. Imagine my surprise to learn it was a Jewish-American factory superintendent in Atlanta! Passepartout said it was convicted of the murder of a 13-year-old employee. Passepartout observed that it wasn't known for its antisemitism. We disagreed as to whether it was held before a single justice. We enjoyed corroboration. It functioned well as a crowbar. I found and admired the abridged trial testimony and closing arguments starting on p&period; 182. Passepartout recalled the time before it was arrested around 11:30 at the factory. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the antisemitism!" said Passepartout. The mood here changed after Conley had burned Phagan's body in the basement furnace. We encountered a mysterious figure, who introduced themselves as Mervyn. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the radical end of the spectrum could be heard alarming notions inspired by the fact that many of Atlanta's factories..." said Mervyn. We moved on, avoiding a shortage of brass sheet metal. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Cypress Hills Cemetery (New York City). I could see that it was opened for burials in 1851 and was designed to emulate a "rural cemetery" setting. Passepartout asked me if it was designed to emulate a "rural cemetery" setting, but I did not know. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to emulate a "rural cemetery" setting. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Salem Fields Cemetery, Brooklyn, we approached Cypress Hills National Cemetery. Passepartout talked about  a hilltop. It was clearly established to honor Civil War veterans. Imagine my surprise to learn it was established as a nonsectarian burial ground! We admired the office. I spent a few minutes examining War of 1812 graves. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Mervyn and I walked to Cypress Hills (BMT Jamaica Line). Passepartout pointed out  an elevated station house beneath the tracks. Passepartout told me it was the terminal for the Jamaica Line when it opened. I could see that it was extended east from this station to 111th Street on May 28. We made full benefit of exit from the system. At this point, Mervyn entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Woodhaven, Queens. It was clearly a nationally famous racetrack situated in the area now bounded by 78th Street. I recalled it was the site of the first skinned -- or dirt -- racing surface. We visited people of many different ethnicities. Passepartout and I silently remembered the bravery of war veterans and collects donations for the Salvation Army for the winter holidays. I admired the parish hall dates to 1907. Passepartout recalled the time before it was replaced in 1942 by underground tracks and a single underground station between Jamaica and Brooklyn. We took some time to enjoy the famous golf course. We moved on, disappointed by the construction of the BMT Jamaica Line. <p class="new">The weather worsened as we approached 104th Street (BMT Jamaica Line). My guidebook claimed it was known as 102nd Street. It was clearly then given the dual name of 102nd-104th Streets. It was within convenient distance of and from the station. We made full benefit of access to and from the station. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at 111th Street (BMT Jamaica Line). Passepartout asked me if it was formerly used to turn trains for the BMT Lexington Avenue Elevated trains from 1917 until 1950, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for train storage." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to 121st Street (BMT Jamaica Line). Passepartout pointed out  the mezzanine beneath the tracks. If I remembered correctly, this was the terminal for the Jamaica Avenue El from April 15. Passepartout asked me if it was replaced by Q49 bus service until the Archer Avenue Line opened up, but I did not know. It seemed perfect for storage. I found and admired a full-height turnstile before reaching the street stairs. The mood here changed after the Archer Avenue Line opened up. We had heard stories of the closed-off station house beneath the tracks. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Kew Gardens, Queens. I could see that it was one of seven planned garden communities built in Queens from the late 19th century to 1950. Passepartout asked me if it was acquired in 1868 by Englishman Albon P&period; Man, but I did not know. I admired the private road where residents can jog or walk year round. Things changed after it was bisected in 1908 by the main line of the Long Island Rail Road. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Archbishop Molloy High School. It was clearly replaced in 1912 with the huge present-day Church. My guidebook claimed it was appointed President of Molloy in July 2010. Passepartout and I enjoyed 6 NBA players. We admired the endowment of about $6&comma;000. We enjoyed the famous successful sports program. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Queens Library. Passepartout talked about  professional job skills certifications. I remembered it was named "2009 Library of the Year" by Library Journal. If I remembered correctly, this was founded in 1858 in Flushing as a subscription service. We visited the International Resource Center (IRC). I spent a few minutes examining books. We made full benefit of an assortment of enriching activities and clubs for children and teens daily. We moved on, avoiding a New York City fiscal crisis. <p class="new">Moving on, we arrived at 169th Street (IND Queens Boulevard Line). Unless I was mistaken, this was the final stop for the Queens Boulevard Line from the station's 1937 opening to 1950. It was clearly extended to Jamaica - 179th Street. We admired the full length mezzanine above the platforms. We avoided the numerous bus lines that either terminated just outside or at the nearby 165th Street Bus Terminal. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered to Thomas A. Edison High School (Queens). Passepartout told me it was required to wear a tie and could rent one for 10 cents from the secretary a day. I admired the enrollment of just over 2&comma;800 students of diverse ethnic backgrounds. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the largely male population!" said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky darkened as we approached St. John's University (New York City). It was clearly originally located in the neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant in the borough of Brooklyn. Unless I was mistaken, this was relocated to its current location to Utopia Parkway in Hillcrest. Passepartout observed that it didn't break the pledge for it was only leasing the structure not building it. We visited several graduate programs in education. We enjoyed and shot in the television studio in the school's TV center. Passepartout and I admired the total of 15&comma;720 undergraduate students and 5&comma;634 graduate students. It seemed perfect for receptions. Passepartout was unimpressed by some of the university's most elite musicians. It was convenient for Manhattan. We took advantage of shuttle bus service for students to access satellite houses. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the dramatic and impassioned performances both on and off campus!" said Passepartout. He explained to us how it had been designed to significantly enhance student life on campus. We were approached by a local shopkeeper, who introduced themselves as Fumihiko. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Academically, St&period; John's University has never ranked high among Catholic schools; in troubles, it outdoes them all." said Fumihiko. We moved on, unsure what to make of an NCAA infraction. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed the site of Jamaica High School. I remembered it was a four-year public high school in Jamaica. It was clearly administered by the New York City Department of Education. Passepartout and I enjoyed the Cleftones and Letty Cottin Pogrebin at the very same time. Passepartout examined the Jamaica Learning Center. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Jamaica – 179th Street (IND Queens Boulevard Line). Imagine my astonishment to learn it was delayed again due to the onset of World War II! It was clearly the last subway station whose construction was funded by New York City. Fumihiko and I admired the total of 15 staircase entrances and 1 elevator entrance. Was it relay tracks? We thought not. We traversed the full-length mezzanine. We noted the onset of the Great Depression. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Hollis, Queens. I remembered it was the site of part of the Battle of Long Island. I could see that it was captured at a tavern on what is now Jamaica Avenue. Fumihiko remembered it becoming a part of New York City with the rest of the borough of Queens. We admired the majority of working parents with many early childhood schools in Hollis. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"WorldStar, Baby!" exclaimed Fumihiko. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Union Turnpike (New York). Imagine my surprise to learn it was once a famous attraction for residents in Queens! Passepartout said it was New York State Route 25C from the mid-1930s to 1970. I found and admired a wide mall with trees. It was handy for or from the parkway to Union Turnpike. Things were never the same after it intersects with Winchester Boulevard. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Long Island Motor Parkway. I could see that it was a parkway on Long Island. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the first roadway designed for automobile use only! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't imagine a worse place for the Long Island Expressway (I-495)." said Passepartout. It was convenient for Peck Avenue just east of the start of the bike path. We took advantage of access to 220th Street just east of Bell Boulevard. Fumihiko explained how it had been designed to include living space for the toll collectors so that toll could be collected at all hours. <p class="new">We hitched a lift to Benjamin N. Cardozo High School. I recalled it was Reginald Vel Johnson. I admired the large number of sports teams. We took advantage of students an emphasis on science and mathematics. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the Mentor Law and Humanities program!" said Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long before Hollywood called, Jeremy was just another Bayside kid who enjoyed afternoons playing on his favorite tree outside his home on Bell Boulevard." said Fumihiko. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Douglaston, Queens. Fumihiko told me it was inherited by his son. I remembered it was taken on as the name of the community. We visited a distinct cultural presence and traditional New York City style delis and pizzerias. I admired the 18-hole. I found and admired a Fairway Market supermarket (which opened in November 2011). We took advantage of live theater at the Douglaston Community Church. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the historical society and other civic groups!" said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Little Neck, Queens. To the best of my knowledge, this was taken by the Daily News in August 1931. It looked as if it was removed to make room for a widened Northern Boulevard. We visited the busiest of approximately a dozen remaining railway grade crossings in New York City. It was hard to believe it was ever a dock on Little Neck Bay. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here rest the last of the Matinecoc." said Fumihiko. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Little Neck (LIRR station). My guidebook claimed it was built in February-May 1870 by the Flushing and North Side Railroad. It looked as if it was built between February and May. At this point, Fumihiko departed from our company, saying that they had business to attend to back at St. John's University (New York City). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Great Neck (LIRR station). It looked as if it was built in 1866 by a subsidiary called the North Shore Railroad. My guidebook said it was acquired by the Flushing and North Side Railroad in 1869. We admired the aluminum sculpture by artist David Saunders that was installed in 2001. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to John L. Miller Great Neck North High School. As far as I knew, this was designed by the noted architectural firm of Guilbert and Betelle. Passepartout said it was expanded in 1900 but then destroyed by fire and replaced by a brick building in 1921. I admired the "open campus" policy. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to United States Merchant Marine Academy. It looked as if it was transferred from the Massachusetts Maritime Academy to Kings Point and renamed the USTS Emory Rice. Passepartout asked me if it was given at temporary facilities until the Academy's permanent site in Kings Point, but I did not know. Passepartout and I admired the Department Head. Passepartout was unimpressed by the Academy's collection of maritime art and artifacts. We took advantage of patrols on foot. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to serve as a training vessel for students. Things were never the same after the Academy's permanent site in Kings Point. <p class="new">We caught a cab to Fort Schuyler. Imagine my surprise to learn it was named in honor of Major General Philip Schuyler of the Continental Army! It was clearly poorly defended against foreign invasion. Passepartout remembered it becoming apparent that the U&period;S&period; coast was poorly defended against foreign invasion. We admired the museum. Passepartout disapproved of it being fitted with various other pieces throughout the ever-modernization of coastal defense artillery. Things were never the same after August 1865 the Fort was garrisoned by companies A. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It began to rain as we approached State University of New York Maritime College. Passepartout said it was replaced by the gunboat Newport. Passepartout remarked that it didn't work and the vessel was mostly gutted after its decommissioning as a Naval vessel. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to introduce them to the regimental lifestyle. We moved on, avoiding the overhead of ship maintenance and student board. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Sylvania Electric Products explosion. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was experimenting with large-scale production of thorium metal from thorium dioxide! Passepartout asked me if it was during the incineration of this material that the explosion occurred, but I did not know. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Fort Totten (Queens). It looked as if it was purchased by the U&period;S&period; Government in 1857 from the Willets family. If I remembered correctly, this was to protect the East River approach to New York Harbor. We visited the Bayside Historical Society. I admired the museum with exhibits about the history of Fort Totten. It seemed perfect for youth soccer. I found and admired a museum with exhibits about the history of Fort Totten. Things were different after taken away to a Federal prison in Texas where he died in 1971. We were hailed by a fellow tourist, who introduced themselves as Robert. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Bayside, Queens. It was clearly settled by English colonists. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was still mostly farmland. We visited Queensborough Community College. We admired the large concentration of European Americans. I spent some time examining 11&comma;439 housing units. It seemed handy for the Cross Island Parkway. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was murdered on a hit called by Vincent "Vinny Gorgeous" Basciano. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! The thirty-three street malls and accents!" said Passepartout. At this point, Robert reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return home via Fort Totten (Queens). We moved on, unsure what to make of a large community of foreign-born European Americans. <p class="new">We caught a cab to Queensborough Community College. It looked as if it was constructed on the site of the former Oakland Country Club golf course. My guidebook said it was founded in 1963 and seats more than 1&comma;000 people. It seemed a fine spot for instruction and extracurricular activities. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to prepare students for transfer to senior institutions. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We doubled back to Auburndale (LIRR station) and caught the next train, alighting near Eugene Bullard. It looked as if it was the first Haitian-American and the first black military pilot. If I remembered correctly, this was one of only a few Black combat pilots in World War I. Passepartout observed that it didn't confirm Bullard's victories. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Fresh Meadows, Queens. Passepartout told me it was part of the Town of Flushing. If I remembered correctly, this was built to connect the Fresh Meadows Road with Hempstead. Passepartout observed that it didn't allow black individuals to live in the Fresh Meadows Housing Development. We visited Klein Farm. Passepartout remembered it becoming the Fresh Meadows Housing Development. We admired the cost of living at approximately twice the national average. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a biking/walking trail also goes through the area as part of the Brooklyn-Queens Greenway?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I said. I found and admired a large group of Conservative and Orthodox Jews as well as groups of Chinese. We were approached by a passer-by, who introduced themselves as A&period;W&period;. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Stump Road." said A&period;W&period;. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Cunningham Park. Passepartout told me it was acquired by the city starting in the 1920s. My guidebook claimed it was originally named Hillside Park. We took advantage of a bike path through Cunningham Park. We traversed the overpass that runs across the Clearview Expressway. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Summit School (Queens). Passepartout told me it was founded in January 2010. I admired the student to teacher-assistant to teacher ratio of 12:1. We met John, a college friend of mine who was passing by. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the News that Matters, when it Matters." said John. <p class="new">We caught a cab to Yeshiva Etzion. It looked as if it was established in 2003 by Rabbi Avraham Gaon. It was clearly not the approach of Maimonides. Passepartout remarked that it didn't accept payment for studies outside of the written Bible(). John explained to us how it had been designed to specifically meet the Bachur's needs. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't ask us if the CDB system works, ask our Talmidim." said John. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Hillcrest Jewish Center Day Camp, we approached Utopia Parkway (Queens). Passepartout told me it was unable to secure enough funding to further develop the area. Did it build a cooperative community for Jewish families interested in moving away from the Lower East Side of Manhattan? We were not sure. <h2>Chapter 49</h2><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Adelphi University. I could see that it was also named a 2010 Best College in the Northeastern Region by The Princeton Review. Passepartout said it was a private preparatory school located at 412 Adelphi Street. We visited the Adelphi New York Statewide Breast Cancer Hotline and Support Program. Passepartout remembered it becoming the School of Education in 1990. We enjoyed former professional soccer player and United States national team member Chris Armas. We joined some tourists who were admiring the second chimney solely to preserve the symmetry of the building. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Challenge of Nursing for Young Women Today." said John. We avoided American involvement in World War II. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled to Cathedral of the Incarnation (Garden City, New York). Passepartout told me it was established in 1876 as a memorial to and mausoleum for Garden City founder. It was clearly that condos that were put in the Village of Garden City. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the historic music ministry!" said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled to Garden City Hotel. Passepartout asked me if it was built in 1983 by the late Myron Nelkin, but I did not know. It was clearly opened to great fanfare on July 30. The mood here changed after it declared bankruptcy and was demolished in the 1973 to make way for the present Garden City Hotel. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Garden City Golf Club. Imagine my surprise to learn it was soon expanded to eighteen holes with a total length of over 6000 yd! Passepartout asked me if it was incorporated as the Garden City Golf Club on May 17, but I did not know. At this point, John reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return home via Summit School (Queens). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Rosa Parks Hempstead Transit Center. To the best of my recollection, this was remodeled in July 1881. Imagine my surprise to learn it was built in February 1913! It seemed perfect for train storage. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to have trains terminate behind the building rather than alongside of it. Things changed after work on this project was finished. We moved on, avoiding an accident from January 1912 involving a milk train that rear-ended a stationary passenger car. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to St. George's Episcopal Church (Hempstead, New York). Imagine my surprise to learn it was listed on the National Register! Unless I was mistaken, this was re-erected in 1734 to replace the original. I spent a while perusing oak interior columns that were dragged across the Hempstead Plains by horse. We met Tiffany, an old colleague of mine who was passing by. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffany drove us to Hempstead High School (New York). I could see that it was not until the mid 20th Century that Garden City and Roosevelt school districts were separated. As far as I knew, this was an attempt to cut these classes. I admired the indoor swimming pool that reopened after renovations in the spring of 2005. We enjoyed the legendary tiger or full-house and power-I formations. Things changed after the mid 20th Century that Garden City and Roosevelt school districts were separated. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to West Hempstead (LIRR station). Passepartout asked me if it was converted into a skating rink that burned down in July 1888, but I did not know. It was clearly merged into the LIRR nine years later. I found and admired a bridge over the tracks and station for the New York and Long Island Traction Company trolleys. At this point, Tiffany entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p class="new">We caught a cab to H. Frank Carey Junior-Senior High School. To the best of my knowledge, this was constructed in 1956 in the Long Island town of Franklin Square. Passepartout asked me if it was named after then Board of Education President, but I did not know. Passepartout and I admired the variety of clubs. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Belmont Park. I could see that it was seeking the Triple Crown but was upset by Birdstone. It looked as if it was considering closing Aqueduct Racetrack. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't only unprecedented in its size. Passepartout and I swapped stories about the five consecutive Belmont Stakes winners trained by Woody Stephens from 1982 to 1986. We enjoyed by music impresario. We joined some tourists who were admiring the history of early aviation shows and tournaments that dates back to the early 1900s. It functioned well as decoration on the south side of the old Belmont grandstand. Times certainly changed after Durkin replaced him in September 1990. We entered into conversation with a local resident, who introduced themselves as Arthur. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you sighted down the stands, you could see some of the beams were twisted." said Arthur. We noted age-induced structural defects and needed to be rebuilt. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Floral Park (LIRR station). If I remembered correctly, this was renamed "Floral Park" by 1890. It was handy for eastbound trains on Track 2 of the Main Line on the north side and westbound trains on Track 1 of the Hempstead Branch on the south side. We moved on, unsure what to make of the presence of the florist John Lewis Childs. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to New Hyde Park (LIRR station) and caught the next train, alighting near Mineola High School (New York). My guidebook told me it was crowned the WGI Northeast Regional Scholastic A Champions at Trumbull. It looked as if it was once again crowned the WGI Northeast Regional Scholastic A Champions at Trumbull. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bus pulled up at Nassau Community College. Passepartout told me it was created as part of the State University of New York (SUNY) in 1959. It looked as if it was a student government club. I admired the housing and other facilities in the vicinity of the Nassau campus. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to serve immediate employment goals of students. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Passepartout asked me if it was located in the Town of Hempstead, but I did not know. If I remembered correctly, this was increased to around 18&comma;000. Passepartout commented that it wasn't planned to begin until at least mid-2009. We visited the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association. We admired the "retired number" banner hanging from the rafters. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't imagine a worse place for sporting events." said Passepartout. He explained how it had been designed to look like a lighthouse. Passepartout disapproved of it being the final WWE event held at the Coliseum. Things changed after the return of the Winnipeg Jets to the league at the 15&comma;004 seat MTS Centre in Winnipeg. We were approached by a local, who introduced themselves as SHoP. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Communication Breakdown." said SHoP. We moved on, unsure what to make of the 2004-05 NHL lockout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Hofstra University. Passepartout asked me if it was founded on the estate of a recently deceased wealthy couple, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was founded as a coeducational. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for a charitable." said Passepartout. It seemed handy for higher education. We took advantage of a program for students whose abilities are not reflected in standardized test scores; while New Opportunities at Hofstra (NOAH) is designed for students whose educational progress to date has been restricted by limited educational opportunities or economic status. He spoke of the time when it was granted 110 acre. Passepartout disapproved of it being an appropriate use of the estate. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have 25 other athletes that have had their numbers retired here at Hofstra, but none of them have ever been retired while they were still here at their last games." said SHoP. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Cradle of Aviation Museum. It looked as if it was the site of many historic flights. To the best of my knowledge, this was already dubbed the "Cradle of Aviation". I spent a short time perusing over 60 aircraft and scale models of airplanes from various time periods. We took some time to enjoy the famous innovative installations. At this point, SHoP had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Roosevelt Field (airport). I could see that it was used as a training field (Hazelhurst Field) for the Air Service. It was clearly renamed in honor of President Theodore Roosevelt's son. It functioned well as a training field (Hazelhurst Field) for the Air Service. We traversed the broad earthen taxi ramp and the consolidated property was named Roosevelt Field. Things were different after it was acquired by real estate developers in 1950. <p class="new">Lost, we  retraced our steps to Roosevelt Field (airport) and booked ourselves onto a plane, alighting near W. Tresper Clarke High School. It was clearly named in honor of William Tresper Clarke. Passepartout asked me if it was the first graduating class, but I did not know. Passepartout and I admired the strong history and tradition in the sport of baseball throughout New York State. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Mall at The Source. As far as I knew, this was managed and co-owned by Simon Property Group. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was built around and which closed in June 2009! We admired the Dave & Buster's&period; It also contained the former Circuit City. I spent a few minutes examining Men's Wearhouse and Tux and Gymboree Play & Music. It was convenient for the Fortunoff court. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of Roosevelt Raceway. Passepartout pointed out  an investigation that would include New York Senator Alfonse D'Amato. It was clearly a racetrack located in the town of Westbury in Long Island. We met Arthur, an old friend of mine who had heard about our journey. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Cemetery of the Holy Rood. I could see that it was transferred to the newly formed diocese. Passepartout asked me if it was eventually absorbed into the assets-management of Cemetery of the Holy Rood or Catholic Cemeteries, but I did not know. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the burial grounds of Saint Brigid's Cemetery (formerly a part of Saint Brigid's Roman Catholic Church). Passepartout mourned it having been absorbed into the assets-management of Cemetery of the Holy Rood or Catholic Cemeteries. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Eisenhower Park. Unless I was mistaken, this was part of the private Salisbury Country Club and included five 18-hole golf courses. Passepartout said it was conducted on the present-day Red Course. We visited the September 11th Memorial for residents of Nassau County. I spent over an hour studying treadmills. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Kellenberg Memorial High School. Passepartout asked me if it was acquired by the Marianist brothers who were already running Chaminade High School in nearby Mineola, but I did not know. He said it was reopened as Kellenberg Memorial in 1987. We enjoyed by student organizations is sold at online music retailers. We admired the separate administration for academics. It seemed a fine spot for athletic purposes. I spent some time studying a koi river. We helped ourselves to a qualitative Catholic education to students from the public schools in grades six through eight. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to serve students who started in public school but wished to transfer into the Catholic system; it now accepts students from both public and Catholic elementary schools. At this point, Arthur entered a nearby restaurant and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Hofstra Arena. As far as I knew, this was renamed the 'David S&period; Mack Sports and Exhibition Complex'. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was also home to the nation's second longest home win streak (behind Gonzaga University) in 2006! We visited the Hofstra University Pride men's and women's basketball teams. <p class="new">A few streets away was James M. Shuart Stadium. Imagine my surprise to learn it was known as Hofstra Stadium until August 29! I could see that it was renamed after the former president of Hofstra University. We visited Hofstra's football team. We bumped into a taxi driver, who introduced themselves as Musco. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of Brookholt. It looked as if it was a Gilded Age mansion on Front Street in East Meadow. I remembered it was built for Oliver and Alva Belmont in 1897. Passepartout observed that it didn't work as Belmont had intended. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"It really does seem as though Fate had decided I am never to sleep peacefully at night." said Musco. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Bellmore–Merrick Central High School District. Passepartout told me it was officially established November 1. If I remembered correctly, this was known as C&period;H&period;S&period;D&period; 3 until May. I tripped over the Meadowbrook Alternative Program the district's alternate learning program. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Wantagh (LIRR station). Musco told me it was built as a South Side Railroad of Long Island depot between 1867 and 1875. My guidebook claimed it was replaced in 1885 and renamed "Wantagh" in 1891. It was hard to believe it was ever a terminal and origin for some Babylon branch trains during the rush hours. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Wantagh Park. I could see that it was named "Best Public Pool on Long Island " by Long Island Press. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for jogging and bicycle riding." said Passepartout. We took advantage of various recreational activities along a picturesque waterfront location. We enjoyed the legendary extreme sports. <p class="new">We still had a long way to go, so we  doubled back to Wantagh (LIRR station) and caught a train, alighting near Massapequa, New York. It looked as if it was rented to the police department in 2006 and currently serves as the Nassau County Police Academy. I could see that it was converted to an elementary school. Musco and I admired the reservation on the South Shore of Long Island. I spent a while perusing old and current pictures of all these schools and many other sites around town important to the thousands of baby boomers raised in the Pequas. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Copiague (LIRR station). My guidebook claimed it was originally built in 1902. It looked as if it was rebuilt with temporary high-level platforms for the M1s on October 25th. Passepartout observed that it wasn't originally built by the South Side Railroad of Long Island. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With poor weather ahead, we  doubled back to Copiague (LIRR station) and caught a train, alighting near Westfield Sunrise. Passepartout asked me if it was remodeled in 1991 and it was acquired by the Westfield Group in 2005, but I did not know. I could see that it was acquired by the Westfield Group in 2005. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Babylon (LIRR station). I remembered it was briefly renamed Seaside station in the summer of 1868. My guidebook said it was provided by the Babylon Rail Road company as a substitute. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the name "Babylon & Fire Island" posted on one side. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  made our way to Babylon (LIRR station) and caught a train, alighting near Belmont Lake State Park. Passepartout asked me if it was established in 1926 on land that was previously a horse farm owned by August Belmont, but I did not know. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was previously a horse farm owned by August Belmont! Things were different after their disbandment in 1977 and 1980. <p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Wyandanch (LIRR station). I recalled it was originally built in May 1875 as "West Deer Park". If I remembered correctly, this was razed in February 1958. Did it support the increased ridership anticipated when LIRR trains begin serving Grand Central station in 2018 (see East Side Access)? We were not sure. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to travel further on foot, we doubled back to Wyandanch (LIRR station) and caught the next train, alighting near Five Towns College. It looked as if it was reaffirmed by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education on November 20. My guidebook said it was founded as a business school in 1972 by Lorraine Kleinman Cohen and Stanley G&period; Cohen. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Half Hollow Hills Central School District. My guidebook told me it was once used as both a middle school and a high school. It looked as if it was constructed of concrete and never completed. We enjoyed a number of Intel Science Talent Search. We joined some tourists who were admiring the recently renovated Lecture Hall. It functioned well as both a middle school and a high school. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the Eugene Orloff Auditorium. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! The district-wide theater programs that extends to all schools in the district!" said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Pilgrim Psychiatric Center. It looked as if it was the largest hospital of any kind in the world. My guidebook said it was to put the patients to work. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't seen by the public until 1981. Musco remembered it becoming the Western Campus of the Suffolk County Community College in 1974. We agreed it was a facility for transloading freight from trains to trucks. It functioned well as a correctional facility in the 1980s. Passepartout was unimpressed by the mother of convicted child kidnapper Andre Rand. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Musco told me about Mason General Hospital. Passepartout asked me if it was a psychiatric hospital run by the United States War Department on Long Island during World War II, but I did not know. It looked as if it was named in honor of Brigadier General Charles Field Mason. It seemed quite suitable for treating the psychological casualties of the battlefield as well as for other related uses. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived not too far from Brentwood High School (New York). Passepartout told me it was named for William H&period; Ross. I could see that it was completed and open for students in September 1964. We admired the adult continuing education programs. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Principal to Stop Listing Those Sitting for Pledge." said Musco. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Academy of Saint Joseph. I could see that it was a Catholic college-preparatory school for Kindergarten to Grade 12. It was clearly accompanied by Sister Baptista Hanson and Sister Theodosia Hegeman from Buffalo. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The high school amplified the abilities of the young women that attended by having small intimate class in which time with the teacher was individualized." said Musco. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Brentwood (LIRR station). Passepartout told me it was originally known as Modern Times station and was renamed Brentwood on September 7. Imagine my surprise to learn it was renamed Brentwood on September 7! At this point, Musco reluctantly left us, saying that they had business to attend to back at James M. Shuart Stadium. <h2>Chapter 50</h2><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Kings Park Psychiatric Center. My guidebook claimed it was a former state-run psychiatric hospital located in Kings Park. I could see that it was established in 1885 by Kings County in nearby Suffolk County. I admired the reputation on Long Island as being haunted. It functioned well as an infirmary for the facility's geriatric patients. I tripped over the Kings Park Psychiatric Center stands as a testament to a forgotten era. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was renamed the Kings Park State Hospital. Things were different after less than a third of the building was in use by 1996. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Smithtown (LIRR station). As far as I knew, this was originally built in 1872 by the Smithtown and Port Jefferson Railroad. It looked as if it was sponsored by the Smithtown Township Arts Council in 1989. At this point, Alfred entered a nearby train station and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  walked to Smithtown (LIRR station) and caught a train, alighting near Hauppauge High School. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was named the 373rd top U&period;S&period; high school of 2008 by Newsweek Magazine. We admired the high number of students enrolled in Advanced Placement (AP) courses. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Bayard Cutting Arboretum State Park. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted for William Bayard Cutting in 1887! I remembered it was damaged in Hurricane Gloria in 1985. Passepartout and I admired the nature trail and recreational programs. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Alfonse M. D'Amato United States Courthouse. I could see that it was decommissioned in 1996 after its last remaining patients were relocated. My guidebook claimed it was originally named the Long Island U&period;S&period; Courthouse. We met Richard, an old friend of mine who was passing by. <p class="new">Lost, we  made our way to Islip (LIRR station) and caught a train, alighting near The Moorings, New York. As far as I knew, this was the conception of Francis Henry Hawkes. It was clearly divided and in turn developed. Passepartout recounted how it had been demolished. The mood here changed after Francis retired and moved with his wife and youngest child to Arizona. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near United States Post Office (Bay Shore, New York). Imagine my surprise to learn it was designed by Louis A&period; Simon and artist Wheeler Williams! I recalled it was not designed in conjunction with the United States Treasury Department. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Bay Shore (LIRR station). My guidebook claimed it was built by the South Side Railroad of Long Island on May 20. Imagine my surprise to learn it was replaced in 1882 and replaced again on July 17! It seemed perfect for the eastbound platform was taken over by the MTA. Things were different after a pedestrian bridge was built in 2009. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Wereholme. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was originally part of Windholme which was eventually split between the children of the owners! My guidebook claimed it was eventually split between the children of the owners. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was split between the children of the owners. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered Aluminaire House. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was designed as a case study by architects A&period; Lawrence Kocher and Albert Frey in April! Passepartout said it was the first all-metal house in the United States. Passepartout observed that it didn't fit with the neighborhood's traditional brick housing. Richard remembered it becoming the core of an extensive complex. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Deer Park (LIRR station). Unless I was mistaken, this was previously located at the bridge over New York State Route 231. Passepartout said it was moved as part of a major reconstruction project of the line at Ronkonkoma. Passepartout remembered it becoming the site of the spur for Edgewood State Hospital. Things were different after it was moved as part of a major reconstruction project of the line at Ronkonkoma. <p class="new">We walked to Deer Park (LIRR station) and caught a train, alighting near John Coltrane Home. I could see that it was in this home that he composed his landmark work. It was clearly the site of Coltrane Studios. Things were different after he died from liver cancer at Huntington Hospital on July 17. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friends of the Coltrane Home." said Richard. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to travel further on foot, we made our way to National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and Museum and arranged passage on a passenger boat. Some time later, it docked near National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and Museum and we walked the rest of the way. It was clearly awarded the Marty Glickman Award. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Arthur Dove. It looked as if it was born to a wealthy family in Canandaigua. Imagine my surprise to learn it was interested in politics and named his son Arthur Garfield! Passepartout remarked that it didn't go to the funeral in Geneva. We agreed it was his last representational work. Richard and I enjoyed what are known as the first purely abstract paintings to come out of America. Passepartout took a photograph of the oil over a wax emulsion; commenting about Tanks. Things were never the same after the Great Depression when both Dove and Torr moved back to the Dove's estate located in Geneva. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Huntington Harbor 1." said Richard. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Vanderbilt Museum. Passepartout told me it was established during 1950. He asked me if it was constructed in three installments, but I did not know. Passepartout observed that it didn't have money for payroll. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for a museum for his marine." said Passepartout. We moved on, avoiding major renovations. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Harborfields High School, we approached Camp Alvernia. Richard told me it was founded in 1888 by the Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn. My guidebook claimed it was based in part on the camp's annual pre-camp orientation program. Things were different after cabins were built in the 1930-40s. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leadership Skills in Community Youth Recreation." said Richard. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to United States Post Office (Northport, New York). Imagine my surprise to learn it was designed by Louis A&period; Simon in conjunction with the United States Treasury Department! Passepartout said it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Northport High School. If I remembered correctly, this was first organized in Northport in 1896. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was finally remedied with the construction of a new Northport High School on Laurel Hill Road. We visited over 2&comma;100 students and 270 staff members and offers the International Baccalaureate program. I admired the well-established and recognized music program. Passepartout was unimpressed by a rock climbing wall and an archery court. It seemed handy for the school's administrative offices and counseling center. We made full benefit of a particularly rich elective program. At this point, Richard entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p class="new">We hitched a lift to Northport (LIRR station). I could see that it was built from Northport Junction to Port Jefferson. I remembered it was renamed Old Northport station. We admired the landing on the same level as the unbuilt outbound platform. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for freight service." said Passepartout. Things were different after the track runs adjacent to Bellrose Avenue School. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Greenlawn (LIRR station) and caught the next train, alighting near N. Velzer House and Caretaker's Cottage. Passepartout told me it was built about 1830 and exhibits restrained Greek Revival details. It was clearly added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Northport Public Library. It looked as if it was designed and built in 1914. Unless I was mistaken, this was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Passepartout remembered it becoming home to the Northport Historical Society Museum. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Northport Power Station and arranged passage on a boat. Some time later, it docked near Delamater-Bevin Mansion and we walked the rest of the way. I could see that it was built by Cornelius Henry DeLamater in 1862 in French Second Empire architectural style. As far as I knew, this was originally known as Vermland. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Northport Power Station, we approached The Crest (Huntington, New York). It was clearly built in 1902 for Oakley Ramshon DeLamater who presented the house as a gift to his wife. Unless I was mistaken, this was the grandson of Cornelius H&period; DeLamater. We met Harry, a college friend of mine who was passing by. <h2>Chapter 51</h2><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Kings Park (LIRR station). Passepartout talked about  the Nissequogue River State Park. It was clearly built by the Smithtown and Port Jefferson Railroad between November and December 1872. Imagine my surprise to learn it was renamed Kings Park station in June 1891! <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Nissequogue River State Park. Unless I was mistaken, this was originally assigned to what is today the Caleb Smith State Park Preserve. It looked as if it was first established in 1999 on a 153 acre portion of the former Kings Park Psychiatric Center property. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near St. James (LIRR station). My guidebook claimed it was originally built in 1869 by the South Side Railroad of Long Island. It looked as if it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Passepartout examined an express house and an outhouse. At this point, Harry departed from our company, saying that they had to return home via The Crest (Huntington, New York). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked not too far from Stony Brook University. Stanford told me it was founded in 1957 in Oyster Bay as State University College on Long Island. If I remembered correctly, this was elected to the Association of American Universities. We visited the School of Dental Medicine. Stanford remembered it becoming a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU). We agreed it was completed in 1980. Stanford and I admired the regional economic impact of over $4. Passepartout examined the majority of academic. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered to Charles B. Wang Center. I remembered it was designed by P&period;H&period; Tuan. If I remembered correctly, this was further fueled by its prolonged construction period. I could hardly hear Stanford over the sound of the fountains that flow from 12 Chinese Zodiac sculptures into the south pool. Was it funded by Charles B&period; Wang through an over 40 million dollar donation to Stony Brook University? We were not sure. At this point, Stanford reluctantly left us, saying that they had business to attend to back at Kate Annette Wetherill Estate. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to spare, we ran to Frank Melville Jr. Memorial Library. I could see that it was renovated almost immediately and greatly expanded and re-dedicated in 1967-1971. I admired the Special Collections Department which houses over 16&comma;000 rare books. I spent a while examining offices for different academic departments. <p class="new">We strolled a short distance to Stony Brook Sports Complex. Passepartout asked me if it was announced that the arena would undergo a $20 million renovation, but I did not know. It was clearly completed by the architectural firm Populous (formerly HOK Sport). We visited the Stony Brook Seawolves swimming team. Passepartout and I admired the capacity of 4&comma;000 spectators. It seemed quite suitable for practice until 2008 when it was announced that the Stony Brook Arena was undergoing renovations. I found and admired the Stony Brook Arena on the west end. Things were never the same after financing can be gathered in the present economic conditions. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I walked to Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium. Passepartout told me it was officially named after Kenneth P&period; LaValle. My guidebook said it was instrumental in getting the legislative funding available for the construction of the stadium. We visited the Division I Stony Brook Seawolves. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I walked to The Stony Brook School. It looked as if it was Frank E&period; Gaebelein. I could see that it was formally incorporated by the state of New York in 1914. Passepartout observed that it wasn't merely an emphasis on strong academics for the education of the mind. We admired the 350-seat dining hall and kitchen. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for assemblies." said Passepartout. He was unimpressed by the Visual and Performing Arts Departments and is used for assemblies. We took advantage of additional practice and training space including an all-purpose gym. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We doubled back to Setauket (LIRR station) and caught a train, alighting near Ward Melville High School. I remembered it was originally designed to have 290700 sqft with capacity for 2&comma;000 students. My guidebook claimed it was completed in the rear of the school while the music rooms were renovated. We enjoyed a total of 85 Intel semi-finalists and 11 finalists. We admired the healthy rivalry with West Islip High School. We made full benefit of for numerous clubs and activities after school. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to have 290700 sqft with capacity for 2&comma;000 students. We moved on, avoiding its religious nature. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Port Jefferson (LIRR station). Passepartout talked about  the Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry. Passepartout told me it was originally built in January 1873 by the Smithtown and Port Jefferson Railroad. He asked me if it was burned on February 1, but I did not know. It functioned well as a yard building. We met Stanford, an old friend and terrible bore who was in the area. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Earl L. Vandermeulen High School. Passepartout told me it was originally built by the Public Works Administration. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was renamed around 1960 in honor of Earl L&period; Vandermeulen! Passepartout observed that they didn't have their own high schools. <p class="new">We still had a long way to go, so we  walked to Port Jefferson (LIRR station) and caught the next train, alighting near Brewster House (East Setauket, New York). Passepartout told me it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was originally built in 1665 and expanded in the early 18th century. At this point, Stanford entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Setauket Presbyterian Church and Burial Ground. Passepartout asked me if it was built in 1812 in the Federal style and is a three-by-five-bay, but I did not know. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was established in the 1660s and contains approximately 800 gravesites. I found and admired the remains of some of the earliest pastors of the church including Nathaniel Brewster (1600-1690). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right around the corner was Battle of Setauket. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was a failed attack during the American Revolutionary War on a fortified Loyalist outpost in Setauket! My guidebook claimed it was a qualified success for the British in 1776. I spent a short time examining bullet holes from the skirmish Lieutenant Colonel Hewlett was favorably mentioned in general orders for his defense of the post. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down not too far from West Meadow Beach Historic District. As far as I could remember, this was achieved on October 28. I could see that it was initiated to guide the project. Passepartout observed that it didn't exist in many places. Passepartout took notes on the historic uses that did not exist in many places. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Simons Center for Geometry and Physics. Imagine my surprise to learn it was founded in 2007 by a gift from the James and Marilyn Simons Foundation! Unless I was mistaken, this was the physicist Michael R&period; Douglas. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to enhance progress. <p class="new">We hitched a lift to Stony Brook University Hospital. Passepartout asked me if it was the first such renovation of the 28-year-old facility, but I did not know. I could see that it was opened inside the hospital in 2005. We visited the Stony Brook Heart Institute. I found and admired the Stony Brook University School of Medicine. It was convenient for the latest medical developments and technology. <h2>Chapter 52</h2><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Wardenclyffe Tower. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was an early wireless transmission station designed and built by Nikola Tesla in Shoreham. Passepartout said it was met with the project's primary backer. Passepartout said that he didn't scientifically test his theories. Passepartout and I enjoyed during its Photo Products era. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a landmark for German submarines?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. Things were never the same after it is nominated by a willing owner. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant. It was clearly built between 1973 and 1984 by the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO). Passepartout said it was completed in 1984 and in 1985 LILCO received federal permission for low-power 5 percent power tests. We encounted some problems with its proximity to the Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Brookhaven National Laboratory. Passepartout asked me if it was formally established in 1947 at the site of Camp Upton, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was owned by the Atomic Energy Commission. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for the study of nanoscale materials." said Passepartout. We took advantage of drinking water for nearby Suffolk County residents. He explained to us how it had been designed to research quark-gluon plasma. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was National Synchrotron Light Source. Passepartout talked about  faster decay. I remembered it was built beginning in 1978 and finished in 1984. It looked as if it was broken for the NSLS on September 28. Passepartout remembered it becoming the basis of design for every synchrotron storage ring. Passepartout and I enjoyed by a 100KeV triode electron gun. I admired the larger wavelength and thus has lower energy which leads to faster decay. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to be 10&comma;000 times brighter. Things were never the same after the advent of 3rd generation light sources. We ignored the change in angular momentum of the electrons. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near St. Andrew's Episcopal Church (Yaphank, New York). If I recalled correctly, this was built in 1853 and was built to resemble a similar church in Massapequa. My guidebook claimed it was built to resemble a similar church in Massapequa. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Yaphank (LIRR station). If I recalled correctly, this was originally built as Milleville station in 1845. It looked as if it was spelled both as Millville or Milleville on LIRR timetables. Passepartout remembered it becoming the stop for special trains with a connecting bus to Parr Meadows Racetrack. Things were different after Manorville and Riverhead stations were built in 1845. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost, we  retraced our steps to Mastic – Shirley (LIRR station) and caught the next train, alighting near William Floyd House. It looked as if it was a home of William Floyd. I could see that it was his home from 1734 until 1803. We met Nicholl, an old friend of Passepartout's who pulled up in a car. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Smith Point County Park. I recalled it was named for William "Tangier" Smith. My guidebook claimed it was originally intended to be part of the Ocean Parkway Extension. It seemed handy for the beach and rest of the park. We made full benefit of access to the beach and rest of the park. <p class="new">Much later we arrived near Suffolk County Almshouse Barn. My guidebook told me it was built in 1871 and the large multi-story barn has a broad gable roof and wood shingle sheathing. It looked as if it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. I admired the broad gable roof and wood shingle sheathing. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Nicholl and I hitched a lift to Brookhaven Rail Terminal. Unless I was mistaken, this was built with $40 million in private funds and opened on September 27. I could see that it was stymied by local opposition. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for on-site switching." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to travel further on foot, we walked to Bartlett's (LIRR station) and caught a train, alighting near American Orthodox Catholic Church – Western Rite Mission, Diocese of New York. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was consecrated for the Americas on May 29. Imagine my surprise to learn it was conducted in Red Oak! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Orthodox, but not Eastern in teaching the Faith, Catholic but not Papal in liturgy and government." said Nicholl. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Medford (LIRR station). If I recalled correctly, this was closed north of Peconic Avenue in 2007. Unless I was mistaken, this was originally opened on June 26. Nicholl and I admired the low clearance of 12 feet. I found and admired a memorial to the victims of the September 11. Things changed after Ohio Avenue was closed north of Peconic Avenue in 2007. At this point, Nicholl entered a nearby train station and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Patchogue (LIRR station). I remembered it was the east end of the South Side Railroad of Long Island. Passepartout asked me if it was a proposal by the SSRRLI to extend the main line southeast towards Bellport, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for hooping." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was United States Post Office (Patchogue, New York). If I recalled correctly, this was built 1930 to the designs by architect John Vredenburgh Van Pelt of Van Pelt. My guidebook claimed it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 11. I spent over an hour examining wrought-iron window guards in the front and on the sides. <p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Bellport (LIRR station). I could see that it was originally built in the summer of 1882 by the Brooklyn and Montauk Railroad. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was closed by the LIRR in 1929! Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to expand the former South Side Railroad of Long Island toward the east end. We avoided low ridership. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Fire Island National Seashore. Passepartout talked about  Fire Island and the national seashore and there are no public roads within the seashore itself. My guidebook claimed it was established as a unit of the National Park Service on September 11. We visited a popular boardwalk trail through an area known as the Sunken Forest as well as a visitor center. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Cherry Grove, New York. Passepartout told me it was designated a National Historic Landmark. I recalled it was the only place with electricity and a phone. Passepartout observed that it wasn't destroyed along with the hotel. We admired the single seasonal post office. We made full benefit of a wide variety of public services to the Grove. We noted the unique nature of Cherry Grove. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Point O' Woods, New York. It was clearly originally organized in 1894 for religious retreats. We admired the small number of motor vehicles for maintenance. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't imagine a worse place for passenger service." said Passepartout. It was handy for the federally funded U&period;S&period; post office located within the Point O' Woods grounds. "Look at the peaceful atmosphere!" Things were different after Nat Hentoff's complaint (described below). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a coach near 116 Sullivan Street. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was built in 1832 as an investment by Charles Starr (bookbinder) and includes some Greek Revival details! Passepartout said it was heightened two stories in 1872. We admired the exceptional treatment of painted timber Ionic half-column sidelights. <h2>Chapter 53</h2><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Center Moriches (LIRR station). Passepartout asked me if it was a station stop along the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, but I did not know. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was located on Railroad Avenue and Hamilton Street in Center Moriches! We avoided low usage. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  walked to Center Moriches (LIRR station) and caught a train, alighting near Long Island Central Pine Barrens. As every schoolboy knows, this was made to create the area a Free trade zone to spur development. Imagine my surprise to learn it was created to review development in the region! Passepartout was unimpressed by a remnant of the Atlantic coastal pine barrens ecoregion. The mood here changed after the 1970s when a proposal was made to create the area a Free trade zone to spur development. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Manorville (LIRR station). Passepartout asked me if it was a railroad station on the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road, but I did not know. If I remembered correctly, this was built in 1844 and closed in 1968. We were greeted by a dishevelled character, who introduced themselves as Oliver. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Manor Station." said Oliver. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Long Island Solar Farm. Imagine my amazement to learn it was engineered by Blue Oak Energy and construction subcontracted to Hawkeye LLC from Hauppauge! To the best of my knowledge, this was published by the U&period;S&period; Department of Energy in May 2013. We admired the long lead time. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Oliver and I hitched a lift to Wampmissic (LIRR station). Passepartout told me it was a station on the Main Line of the Long Island Rail Road. I remembered it was named after the Native American name for extensive swamps two miles west of Manorville. It functioned well as a meeting and passing location. <p class="new">Time was running short, so we  made our way to Wampmissic (LIRR station) and caught a train, alighting near W26CE. Passepartout asked me if it was owned by WFUV as the first audio to be broadcast in New York City, but I did not know. It looked as if it was sold to current Atlantic Coast Communications INC. <p class="new">We walked to Westhampton (LIRR station) and caught a train, alighting near Casa Basso. Passepartout asked me if it was originally purchased in the late 19th century by American artist Theophilus Brower, but I did not know. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was purchased by Valerio "Rene" Mondini. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to United States Post Office (Westhampton Beach, New York). As far as I could remember, this was designed by Louis A&period; Simon in conjunction with the United States Treasury Department. Imagine my surprise to learn it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989! <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down not too far from Quogue (LIRR station). Passepartout asked me if it was built around 1882 and later was moved to a private location around 1905, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was moved to a private location around 1905. We encounted some problems with low usage. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Riverhead (LIRR station). Imagine my amazement to learn it was moved for use as a railroad bunkhouse in March 1870 and the second depot was opened the same month! It looked as if it was opened the same month. I admired the high level platform and other amenities instead. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for signal maintainers until the end of the 20th Century." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Bishop McGann-Mercy Diocesan High School. I remembered it was decided that a junior high school was to be added to the already ninth through twelfth grades. Passepartout asked me if it was to be added to the already ninth through twelfth grades, but I did not know. <h2>Chapter 54</h2><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Greenport (LIRR station). Imagine my amazement to learn it was originally built on July 29! My guidebook claimed it was listed as Green-Port on the 1852 timetable. At this point, Charles had to leave, saying that they had to return home via Cherry Creek Golf Links. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Union Chapel (Shelter Island Heights, New York). Passepartout asked me if it was built in 1875 and is a wood-frame structure with wood-shingle sheathing, but I did not know. It was clearly added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Passepartout and I admired the -story bell tower with a double-door center entrance at its base; a small porch shelters the entry. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Greenport (LIRR station) and caught the next train, alighting near James Havens Homestead. My guidebook told me it was built in 1743 and expanded in the early- mid-19th century. Passepartout asked me if it was enlarged to four bays with a wide two story, but I did not know. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Plum Island Animal Disease Center. It looked as if it was conducted at the site. My guidebook claimed it was purchased by the government for the construction of Fort Terry. Passepartout observed that it didn't merit its $16. Passepartout took a photograph of the fringe literature with a portrayal of almost every form of novelist style. Things were different after the entire program was canceled in 1969 by Richard Nixon. We moved on, avoiding the currents and proximity to the mainland. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of Fort Terry. It looked as if it was a coastal fortification on Plum Island. My guidebook claimed it was established in 1897 and used intermittently through the end of World War II. We visited an advanced fire regulation system as well as a position finding system. Passepartout remembered it becoming an animal and biological warfare research facility. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a look-out for German U-boats and planes?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. Passepartout disapproved of it being staffed by less than 20 personnel. Times certainly changed after Richard Nixon ended the U&period;S&period; bio-weapons program in 1969. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Great Gull Island. I could see that it was the home of large colonies of nesting terns up until the end of the 19th century. Passepartout said it was constructed on Great Gull Island to guard the entrance to Long Island Sound. We moved on, disappointed by the inavailability of a complete and authoritative census. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Race Rock Light. I could see that it was the site of many shipwrecks. It looked as if it was built between 1871 and 1878. I admired the fourth-order Fresnel lens in a tower standing 67 ft above the waterline. The mood here changed after the breaking up of the ice in the spring. We entered into conversation with a dishevelled character, who introduced themselves as Francis. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Various efforts have been made, and numerous appropriations expended, in endeavoring to place an efficient and permanent mark on this point." said Francis. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a coach near Mitchell College. It was clearly founded in 1938 on the former estate of Alfred Mitchell. It looked as if it was awarded membership in the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. We admired the recognized tradition of support for students with learning differences. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to the four large residence halls. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Fort Trumbull. Francis told me it was demolished in the late 2000's as part of a plan for the economic development of New London. As far as I knew, this was appealed in a lawsuit that reached the US Supreme Court in 2005. Passepartout commented that it wasn't able to get financing for the project. It was hard to believe it was ever a site for concerts and other special events. Times certainly changed after about five or six hundred of the enemy having forced the pickets had entered through the breach. <p class="new">We hailed a cab to New London Union Station. Francis pointed out  a short high-level platform south of State Street. Francis told me it was the last station designed by famed architect H&period;H&period; Richardson. Unless I was mistaken, this was converted into a station. Passepartout observed that it wasn't maintained in order to cut costs. It was within convenient distance of the northbound platform requires crossing both Northeast Corridor tracks. We helped ourselves to accessible boarding for trains using the track. Francis explained how it had been designed to be converted to an island platform should passenger service return to the NECR track. We moved on, disappointed by opposition from Cross Sound Ferry over use of its property. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to New London, Connecticut. It was clearly the world's third busiest whaling port after New Bedford. It looked as if it was called Nameaug by the Pequot Indians. Passepartout observed that it wasn't able to get financing for the project. We visited Connecticut College. I admired the respected symphony orchestra. It seemed perfect for private economic development. Things were different after early November - almost three weeks later than parts of northern Connecticut. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis gave us a lift to Battle of Groton Heights. It looked as if it was a battle of the American Revolutionary War fought on September 6. Unless I was mistaken, this was burned along with several ships but many more escaped upriver. Passepartout commented that it wasn't far distant. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a base for further operations into the interior of New England?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"See for yourself." I replied. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a large quantity of gunpowder. Things changed after it was already daylight on September 6. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember Ft." said Francis. We encounted some problems with the chance that further musket fire might set off the fort's powder magazine. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather worsened as we approached Fort Griswold. It looked as if it was foiled as a patriot put out the British fire before it could reach Griswold's gunpowder stores. Passepartout said it was killed with his own sword. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to mount 10-inch Rodman cannons. Passepartout whispered it was believed to have been the oldest soldier on active duty at that time. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Thames River Bridge (Amtrak). Passepartout told me it was originally a Strauss heel-trunnion Warren through-truss bascule design. My guidebook claimed it was built by the American Bridge Company for the New York. We made full benefit of of horizontal clearance. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to carry a second set of double-track spans. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Groton Monument. It was clearly originally 127 ft high. I could see that it was removed and replaced by an iron-capped pyramid in emulation of the Bunker Hill Monument. Passepartout disapproved of it being required if the monument were to continue to survive. At this point, Francis entered a nearby museum and bade us farewell. <p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Mystic massacre. I recalled it was killed and his trading ship looted by natives suspected to be Pequot. My guidebook said it was killed by the Narragansett forces. Passepartout observed that it didn't and Freeman arguing that it did. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was killed by the Mohawk. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to La Amistad. I remembered it was a 19th-century two-masted schooner built in the US but owned by a Spaniard living in Cuba. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't a slave ship; it was not designed to transport large cargoes of slaves. Passepartout and I silently remembered the revolt of slaves on the ship by the same name. We admired the external ballast keel made of lead and two Caterpillar diesel engines. It functioned well as fastenings throughout the ship. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to transport large cargoes of slaves. We were approached by a local shopkeeper, who introduced themselves as Steven. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked a short distance to Mystic Seaport. It was clearly established in 1929 as the "Marine Historical Association". Imagine my astonishment to learn it was one of the first living history museums in the United States! Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a collection of carved ship figureheads. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We approached Australia (schooner). My guidebook claimed it was built in 1862 in Great South Bay. I could see that it was originally named Alma. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was an exhibit on ship construction?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. Steven explained how it had been designed to carry freight and to be able to traverse shallow water. Times certainly changed after she was captured by Union warships and sold at auction. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This was also the location of Florence (dragger). It looked as if it was used as a dragger in Long Island Sound. Passepartout said it was acquired by Mystic Seaport and completely restored to her original configuration. It was hard to believe it was ever a dragger in Long Island Sound. At this point, Steven reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return home via La Amistad. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Mystic Seaport and arranged passage on a passenger boat. Some time later, it docked near Thomas Minor and we walked the rest of the way. I could see that it was a founder of New London and Stonington. My guidebook claimed it was the daughter of Walter Palmer. We looked for diaries to but could not find any. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Little Narragansett Bay. If I recalled correctly, this was once part of Napatree Point until the two were separated by the Hurricane of 1938. Passepartout was unimpressed by the islands of Sandy Point. Things changed after the two were separated by the Hurricane of 1938. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Flying Horse Carousel. Passepartout asked me if it was originally sand Children younger than 12 years old may ride, but I did not know. It looked as if it was originally part of a traveling carnival. It was convenient for the space in which the horses fly when the carousel is in operation. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Watch Hill Light. It was clearly installed to differentiate the light from that of the Stonington Harbor Light in Connecticut. As far as I knew, this was built next to the lighthouse where it operated until the 1940s and was destroyed in 1963. Things were never the same after the 1940s and was destroyed in 1963. <p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Misquamicut State Beach. I recalled it was created in 1959 after a devastating hurricane in 1954 destroyed much of the Misquamicut community. My guidebook claimed it was nearly forced to close when the forty-year-old septic system broke. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't allowed to build a new septic field so a switch was made to a waterless form of waste management. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Westerly State Airport. It was clearly paved and expanded when it became a U&period;S&period; Navy base during World War II. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was allocated to repair and improve the main runway and taxiways. Passepartout remembered it becoming a U&period;S&period; Navy base during World War II. We noted its prime location halfway between Boston and New York City. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Joseph Stanton House. I could see that it was built sometime before 1739 by Joseph Stanton II. My guidebook said it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. We admired the relatively plain finish. We made full benefit of additional space for modern restaurant facilities. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Carolina, Rhode Island. I could see that it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Passepartout asked me if it was then known as Nichols Bridge, but I did not know. Times certainly changed after its sale to the State of Rhode Island in 1995. We met Ellison, a college friend of mine who worked nearby. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Kingston Railroad Station (Rhode Island). Unless I was very much mistaken, this was built at this location in 1875 by the New York. Passepartout asked me if it was approximately 20 minutes before passenger service ended unofficially in June, but I did not know. Passepartout commented that it didn't go through the village of Kingston. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a second waiting room with outlets and extra seating?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I said. We noted increasing ridership at the station. <p class="new">Ellison gave us a lift to Keaney Gymnasium. Passepartout told me it was named in honor of Rhode Island football coach. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was built to replace Rodman Hall. We visited the University of Rhode Island Rams men's basketball team before it moved to Ryan Center in 2002. Passepartout was unimpressed by the school's library sciences. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Meade Stadium. I remembered it was renamed in 1936 to honor John E&period; "Jack" Meade. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was said to have never missed a game in the stadium until his death in 1972. We visited the University of Rhode Island Rams football team. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Ellison and I hitched a lift to University of Rhode Island. Passepartout asked me if it was first chartered as the state's agricultural school and agricultural experiment station in 1888, but I did not know. It looked as if it was originally the Oliver Watson Farm. Passepartout and I enjoyed television show that deals with student organization and events. Passepartout and I admired the award-winning Greek System. We admired the famous nursing and engineering programs. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Wakefield, Rhode Island. To the best of my knowledge, this was the traditional county seat of Washington County. It was clearly listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996 as Wakefield Historic District. It seemed quite suitable for textile manufacturing. We moved on, avoiding its location on the Saugatucket River and the old Post Road. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Prout School. My guidebook claimed it was founded in 1966 by the Sisters of the Cross and Passion of Manchester. To the best of my knowledge, this was originally an all female institution called Prout Memorial High School. Passepartout remembered it becoming a co-educational institution and was renamed the Prout School. I admired the very large active arts program including theatre. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to The Towers (Narragansett, Rhode Island). As far as I knew, this was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was the center of social life in Narragansett during the late 19th century! Things were different after it burned to the ground in 1900. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to Gardencourt. As far as I could remember, this was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Passepartout said it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. We entered into conversation with a passer-by, who introduced themselves as William. <p class="new">Passepartout suggested that we visit Gladstone Springhouse and Bottling Plant. Imagine my surprise to learn it was constructed in 1899 by T&period; G&period; Hazard! I recalled it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. I found and admired the doorway to the building. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout told me about Greene Inn. It looked as if it was an historic summer resort hotel at 175 Ocean Road in Narragansett. Passepartout asked me if it was designed as a year-round facility in what was then a seasonal summer resort area, but I did not know. At this point, William reluctantly left us, saying that they had business to attend to back at Gardencourt. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to The Dunes Club. Unless I was mistaken, this was washed away by the New England Hurricane of 1938. I could see that it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. It seemed quite suitable for small formal events. It seemed handy for a casual snack bar offering lunch foods as well as ice cream. We were approached by a local shopkeeper, who introduced themselves as Thomas. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Beavertail State Park. My guidebook claimed it was part of Fort Burnside. As far as I knew, this was replaced by a fieldstone tower which was in use until 1856. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for the Naval Radio Station (NAVRADSTA) Jamestown." said Passepartout. He examined the Beavertail Lighthouse Museum. Thomas explained how it had been designed to protect Narragansett Bay. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Newport Jazz Festival and arranged passage on a passenger boat. Some time later, it docked near Newport Jazz Festival and we walked the rest of the way. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was established in 1954 by socialite Elaine Lorillard. If I remembered correctly, this was known as the JVC Jazz Festival from 1984 to 2008. Passepartout remarked that it didn't stand up well to such a large event. We enjoyed by Sid Bernstein in cooperation with a group of Newport businessmen. Thomas and I admired the relaxed role in festival operations. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Newport New England Jazz Festival." said Thomas. We avoided the difficulty of the previous year's festival. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Hammersmith Farm. If I recalled correctly, this was the childhood home of First Lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy. Passepartout said it was referred to as the "Summer White House". Things were different after the 1976 death of Hugh Auchincloss. At this point, Thomas entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. We encounted some problems with many successive winters of freezing and expansion. <p class="new">We wandered a short distance to Newport Country Club. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was at the peak of its prestige as the favorite summer colony of America's wealthy elite! Passepartout said it was played almost exclusively by the rich when it was first introduced to the United States. We bumped into a taxi driver, who introduced themselves as Donald. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Fort Adams. It looked as if it was later instrumental in starting the War of 1812. I could see that it was designed by Major Louis de Tousard of the Army Corps of Engineers. Passepartout remembered it becoming the most complex fortification in the Western Hemisphere. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't imagine a worse place for the filming of the PBS television movie The Scarlett Letter." said Passepartout. We made full benefit of guided tours at the fort and oversees ongoing restoration work at the fort. The mood here changed after the mid-1970s Fort Adams fell victim to neglect. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Hunter House (Newport, Rhode Island). To the best of my knowledge, this was built in 1748 for Colonial Deputy Governor Jonathan Nichols. Unless I was mistaken, this was sold to Colonel Joseph Wanton. We admired the balustraded gambrel roof and heavy stud construction. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was the headquarters of Admiral de Ternay?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I replied. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the woodwork!" said Passepartout. At this point, Donald entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Newport Tower (Rhode Island). Unless I was very much mistaken, this was slightly shorter than the north-south measurement of 19 ft. I recalled it was described as having been used as a powder store "some time past". Passepartout observed that it wasn't common in England until the beginning of the 18th century. Passepartout and I admired the height of 28 ft and an exterior width of 24 ft. It functioned well as a haymow. The mood here changed after the beginning of the 18th century. We met Benedict, an old colleague of mine who was passing by. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stone Wind Mill." said Benedict. We noted the unevenness of the rubble masonry. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky darkened as we approached International Tennis Hall of Fame. It looked as if it was commissioned in 1880 by James Gordon Bennett. I could see that it was designed by Charles McKim along with Stanford White. We admired the vast collection of artifacts and memorabilia &ndash; including videos. Passepartout took a photograph of the Victorian Shingle Style architecture. I found and admired a vast collection of artifacts and memorabilia &ndash; including videos. At this point, Benedict reluctantly left us, saying that they had to return home via Newport Tower (Rhode Island). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Newport Casino. I could see that it was designated a National Historic Landmark on February 27. If I remembered correctly, this was the site of the earliest US Opens. Passepartout observed that it didn't take this kindly. We visited the National Tennis Club. Passepartout examined the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Passepartout disapproved of it being demolished to make way for more modern retail space. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Richard and I walked to John N. A. Griswold House. Passepartout asked me if it was built in 1864 by Richard Morris Hunt for John Griswold, but I did not know. It was clearly landscaped in the early 19th century to a design by the Olmsted Brothers. We visited the Newport Art Museum and houses an art gallery. I admired the art gallery. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Redwood Library and Athenaeum. Passepartout asked me if it was constructed in 1750 by the architect Peter Harrison, but I did not know. He said it was the first classical public building built in America. Passepartout examined the majority of the original books that were purchased as a collection in London. At this point, Richard had to leave, saying that they had to return to Kingscote (mansion). <p class="new">Moving on, we arrived at Newport, Rhode Island. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was 24&comma;027 as of 2013! It looked as if it was formed under the leadership of John Clarke. Passepartout remarked that it didn't last long in Newport. We visited many beaches. Passepartout and I swapped stories about Rochambeau's contributions to the Revolutionary War and to Newport's history. Passepartout and I enjoyed sugar and molasses from the Caribbean were carried to Rhode Island and distilled into rum. We admired the total area of 29. It functioned well as a naval base to attack New York (which they had recently occupied). Passepartout was unimpressed by the United States Naval War College. We enjoyed the famous history of the tall ships and the tall ships racing in which teams from all over the country compete. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Touro Cemetery. Passepartout told me it was founded in 1677 or possibly earlier. To the best of my knowledge, this was recorded on 28 Feb 1677 for a certain parcel of land. We noted the dearth of Jews in New England during that time and the Colonial era. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at John Tillinghast House. Passepartout told me it was probably occupied by the Marquis de Chastellux. My guidebook claimed it was stationed in Newport. We visited William C&period; Gibbs while he was Governor of Rhode Island. Passepartout whispered it was thought to have been occupied by the Marquis de Chastellux. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled to United Congregational Church (Newport, Rhode Island). It looked as if it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2012. My guidebook claimed it was gathered as Newport's First Congregational Church in 1695 by Rev. We enjoyed twenty stained glass windows and a series of murals. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was barracks and hospitals by the British and French troops in Newport?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. We met Joseph, an old friend of mine who had heard about our journey. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Trinity Church (Newport, Rhode Island). Passepartout asked me if it was designed by architect Richard Munday and constructed in 1725-26, but I did not know. I remembered it was investigating charges of the infractions of the Navigation Acts in Rhode Island. It was hard to believe it was ever a garrison church by the British Army in 1776-1778. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Joseph and I walked to Vernon House. I could see that it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1968. It looked as if it was after alterations made in 1759. Passepartout said it was thought to have been done shortly after the younger Bowler's purchase. At this point, Joseph departed from our company, saying that they had business to attend to back at United Congregational Church (Newport, Rhode Island). We noted an extensive alteration to an older structure in 1759. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to Artillery Company of Newport. I recalled it was the first chartered independent unit in the Rhode Island Militia. If I remembered correctly, this was granted the right to elect its own officers. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't part of the National Guard it was not called into Federal service during the First World War. I admired the museum which features an extensive collection of military uniforms from over 50 different nations. Passepartout examined a museum which features an extensive collection of military uniforms from over 50 different nations. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered to Newport Historic District (Rhode Island). My guidebook told me it was during the years from its founding in 1639 to the American Revolution. Passepartout asked me if it was also used to build Trinity Church, but I did not know. Passepartout remembered it becoming a more important port. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was sets for scenes in the film?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. I spent a while examining much high-quality woodworking and furniture from Newport cabinetmakers of the period. We moved on, unsure what to make of its history. <p class="new">A few streets away was Great Friends Meeting House. I recalled it was used as a house of worship until the New England Yearly Meeting of Friends departed in 1905. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a house of worship until the New England Yearly Meeting of Friends departed in 1905?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. Things were never the same after the New England Yearly Meeting of Friends departed in 1905. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Levi H. Gale House. Passepartout asked me if it was built in 1835 for attorney Levi Gale, but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was moved from its original location on Washington Square because of the erection of the Courthouse! It functioned well as a Jewish community center. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We doubled back to St. George's School, Newport and arranged passage on a boat. Some time later, it docked near St. George's School, Newport and we walked the rest of the way. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was founded in 1896 by the Rev. Passepartout asked me if it was completely renovated, but I did not know. Passepartout remembered it becoming a Schoolhouse in 1911. Passepartout and I admired the larger hall used for presentations or examinations. It was hard to believe it was ever the school gymnasium in 1903. Passepartout examined the College Counseling Offices on the main level. We met Ralph, an old friend of mine who pulled up in a car. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Whitehall Museum House. It looked as if it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Passepartout asked me if it was buried in the churchyard at Trinity Church on 5 September 1731, but I did not know. Things were never the same after he could find accommodation elsewhere. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Newport State Airport (Rhode Island) and arranged passage on a fishing boat. Some time later, it docked near Naval Undersea Warfare Center and we walked the rest of the way. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was founded in Newport on Goat Island. Passepartout said it was built in 1907 to manufacture steam torpedoes for the United States Navy. Ralph and I enjoyed a nonfunctional design. It functioned well as smokeless powder for United States naval artillery through the World Wars. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Naval Academy Preparatory School. I remembered it was temporarily inactive during a 15-month period around 1950. It looked as if it was reactivated in 1951 because of the Korean War. We visited the Naval War College. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naval Academy Preparatory School Reefpoints." said Ralph. We noted issued uniforms and miscellaneous items. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Naval War College. It looked as if it was established on October 6. Imagine my surprise to learn it was opened as the college's new home! We visited the Henry E&period; Eccles Library. I spent over an hour perusing a 432-seat auditorium. We made full benefit of direct curriculum support to our educational programs and focused. We traversed the two enclosed bridges. Things were different after the Naval Electronic Warfare Simulator was built in Sims Hall in 1957. <p class="new">Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Malbone Castle and Estate. To the best of my recollection, this was built on this property. It was clearly an eminent New York lawyer and descendant of two signers of the Declaration of Independence. We admired the history dating to the mid-18th century. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Middletown High School (Rhode Island). As far as I could remember, this was killed on 5 November 2010 by an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan. Passepartout asked me if it was shut down due to protests of an anti-grinding rule, but I did not know. We moved on, disappointed by protests of an anti-grinding rule. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to travel further on foot, we retraced our steps to Newport Creamery and arranged passage on the next boat. Some time later, it docked near Gardiner Pond Shell Midden and we walked the rest of the way. Passepartout told me it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  walked to Clambake Club of Newport and arranged passage on the next boat. Some time later, it docked near The Breakers and we walked the rest of the way. Passepartout told me it was built as the Newport summer home of Cornelius Vanderbilt II. It looked as if it was constructed between 1893 and 1895. Passepartout and I recalled the American Expeditionary Force of WWI. We joined some tourists who were admiring the gross area of 125&comma;339 square feet and 62&comma;482 square feet of living area on five floors. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for recitals and dances." said Passepartout. I spent a few minutes studying eight bedrooms and a sitting room decorated in Louis XVI style walnut paneling by Ogden Codman. We made full benefit of further contrast with that of the colored marble. He explained how it had been designed to match. We were approached by a local resident, who introduced themselves as Richard. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I laugh at great wealth, and never miss it; nothing but wisdom matters in the end." said Richard. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We approached The Breakers (1878). If I remembered correctly, this was located on Ochre Point Avenue. Imagine my surprise to learn it was designed by Ernest Bowditch! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a children's playhouse?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. <p class="new">Passepartout, Richard and I walked to Chateau-sur-Mer. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the most palatial residence in Newport until the Vanderbilt houses in the 1890s! Passepartout asked me if it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2006, but I did not know. I admired the Italianate design. We looked for rooms that but weren't able to find any. Things were different after the Vanderbilt houses in the 1890s. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Ochre Court, we approached Seaview Terrace. Imagine my surprise to learn it was designed in the French Renaissance Revival Châteauesque style! As far as I knew, this was the last of the great "Summer Cottages" constructed. I admired the Tremolo Electric Detached Console Automatic Player which includes Great pipes. It seemed quite suitable for entertaining during the summer season. Passepartout examined the American syndicate of The Americas Cup. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Rosecliff. I recalled it was built by Theresa Fair Oelrichs. My guidebook claimed it was one of the four partners in the Comstock Lode. Passepartout observed that it wasn't completed until 1902. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the large parties they threw at Rosecliff; many of which had mardi gras theme!" said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Marble House. I could see that it was designed by the society architect Richard Morris Hunt. Passepartout said it was unparalleled in design and opulence when it was built. Passepartout explained to us how it had been designed to display Alva Vanderbilt's collection of Medieval and Renaissance decorative objects. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Belcourt of Newport. My guidebook told me it was intended to be used for only six to eight weeks of the year. If I remembered correctly, this was well noted for its extensive stables and carriage areas. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for only six to eight weeks of the year." said Passepartout. Was it used for only six to eight weeks of the year? We were not sure. The mood here changed after Belmont saw his completed mansion. We bumped into a local, who introduced themselves as Richard. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Belcourt of Newport." said Richard. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to The Elms (Newport, Rhode Island). If I recalled correctly, this was designed by architect Horace Trumbauer for the coal baron Edward Julius Berwind. Passepartout asked me if it was copied from the Château d'Asnières in Asnières-sur-Seine, but I did not know. Passepartout remarked that it didn't want it and fruitlessly tried to pass The Elms to someone else in the family. We admired the grand ballroom. I spent a while examining bedrooms for the family and guests as well as a private sitting room. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Richard and I walked to Newport Music Festival. It looked as if it was composed of 60 members of the New York Philharmonic. If I remembered correctly, this was produced featuring soloists from The Metropolitan Opera. We enjoyed featuring soloists from The Metropolitan Opera. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Isaac Bell House. My guidebook told me it was the summer resort of choice for America's wealthiest families. Unless I was mistaken, this was a successful cotton broker and investor. At this point, Richard entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I walked to Edward King House. I could see that it was built between 1845 and 1847. Unless I was mistaken, this was the largest and grandest house in Newport when it was built. Passepartout and I admired the notable Southern counterpart in Kenworthy Hall. Passepartout was unimpressed by the Newport Public Library. <p class="new">Crossing a main road, we approached Capt. John Mawdsley House. Passepartout asked me if it was built on Spring Street before 1680, but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983! Things were different after it was sold in the late twentieth century. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by was St. Mary's Church (Newport, Rhode Island). Passepartout told me it was built directly east of the church. I remembered it was moved from its site at Spring and Gidley Streets to its current location at 398 Thames Street. We met Ambrose, an old friend of mine who was passing by. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Admiral Fitzroy Inn. Passepartout asked me if it was designed by architect Dudly Newton, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was moved from the original site. We admired the conference room. Passepartout was unimpressed by the first private Catholic school in Rhode Island. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to spare, we walked to Samuel Whitehorne House. Passepartout asked me if it was built for Samuel Whitehorne Jr, but I did not know. It looked as if it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Passepartout took a photograph of the Federal style mansions at 414 Thames Street in Newport. At this point, Ambrose had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at St. Mary's Church (Newport, Rhode Island). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to Coronet (yacht). I recalled it was the first registered yacht to cross Cape Horn from East to West. It looked as if it was used for a Japanese-American scientific excursion during an eclipse. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for a Japanese-American scientific excursion during an eclipse." said Passepartout. We were hailed by a local shopkeeper, who introduced themselves as William. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With some urgency, we ran to Newport Steam Factory. Unless I was mistaken, this was built in 1831 by a group of local businessmen in an effort to boost the local economy. Imagine my surprise to learn it was used as a cotton mill until 1857! It functioned well as a cotton mill until 1857. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Clifton Burying Ground. Unless I was mistaken, this was likely moved from another location. Passepartout asked me if it was for Sarah Howland who died in 1856, but I did not know. We admired the marker in the Coddington Cemetery on Farewell Street. <p class="new">We wandered to Bellevue Avenue/Casino Historic District. It was clearly listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the Travers Building! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the large number of Gilded Age mansions which line it!" said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  walked to Newport Steam Factory and arranged passage on a passenger boat. Some time later, it docked near Lyman C. Josephs House and we walked the rest of the way. I could see that it was built for the Josephs family of Baltimore. As far as I knew, this was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Dennis J. Murphy House at Ogden Farm. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was originally more extensive when built. Passepartout asked me if it was damaged in the New England Hurricane of 1938 and reduced in scope, but I did not know. Passepartout and I admired the cross-gable roof line. At this point, William entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Wilbor House. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was used for farming between 1690 (when the house was built) and 1955. If I remembered correctly, this was acquired by the historical society. It seemed perfect for farming between 1690 (when the house was built) and 1955. Passepartout said it was thought to have been a stone ender built by Samuel Wilbor. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Little Compton, Rhode Island. Passepartout told me it was 3&comma;492 at the time of the 2010 census. Passepartout observed that it wasn't created for the poultry fanciers. We admired the total area of 28. Passepartout was unimpressed by the town's K-12 facilities. <h2>Chapter 55</h2><p class="new">We parked near Padanaram, Massachusetts. If I remembered correctly, this was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. I could see that it was burned down and all cattle killed. We visited a diverse selection of locally owned and operated retail stores. Passepartout remembered it becoming a shipbuilding center. I admired the population of 11&comma;320 residents with a median household income of $100&comma;836. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus not too far from Dartmouth High School (Massachusetts). My guidebook claimed it was moved to its new location at the end of Bakerville Road. I could see that it was stabbed to death by classmates who barged into the classroom armed with baseball bats. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really the town hall?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. We avoided the severity of the crime and that it was the first of its kind in the school's history. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked not too far from Buttonwood Park Zoo. Passepartout asked me if it was found outside in subzero temperatures during a blizzard, but I did not know. Unless I was mistaken, this was founded to manage the membership program. We visited a variety of North American wildlife and it supports many conservation programs. I found and admired the zoo's two Asian elephants. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus not too far from New Bedford Whaling Museum. Passepartout told me it was filmed in New Bedford. It looked as if it was attracting four to ten thousand visitors a year. We visited a vibrant Azorean community. We joined some tourists who were admiring the extensive collection of fine art. Passepartout was unimpressed by an extensive collection of fine art. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Effie M. Morrissey. I could see that it was a schooner skippered by Robert Bartlett that made many scientific expeditions to the Arctic. My guidebook said it was the last fishing schooner built for the Wonson Fish Company. Things changed after the late nineteen sixties when interest arose in the United States to save the historic vessel. We met George, an old friend of mine who had heard about our journey. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to New Bedford Historic District. It was clearly the center of the American whaling industry. If I remembered correctly, this was recognized as a local historic district and protected by local zoning. It functioned well as the National Park Service's visitors' center. It was handy for the waterfront that spurred the area's original development. At this point, George had to leave, saying that they had to return to Effie M. Morrissey. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This was also the location of Old Third District Courthouse. My guidebook claimed it was built in 1853 by Russell Warren in the Greek Revival architectural style. Imagine my surprise to learn it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places! Passepartout remembered it becoming a store. <p class="new">Passepartout and I walked to Central New Bedford Historic District. I remembered it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was designed by Russell Warren and built in 1838-39. We encountered a local, who introduced themselves as Oscar. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Nathan and Mary (Polly) Johnson properties. Passepartout made a joke about  a large space between the attic and the high ceilings of the first floor. Passepartout asked me if it was moved when the new one was built c&period; 1823, but I did not know. It looked as if it was built c&period; 1823. It was hard to believe it was ever a shop. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Oscar and I walked to Rotch-Jones-Duff House and Garden Museum. Passepartout asked me if it was Upjohn's first house, but I did not know. He said it was bought by local preservationists and reopened as a historic house museum. At this point, Oscar had to leave, saying that they had to return home via Central New Bedford Historic District. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun came out as we approached William J. Rotch Gothic Cottage. Imagine my amazement to learn it was built in 1845 to a design by noted New York City architect Alexander Jackson Davis! I remembered it was built for William J&period; Rotch. We admired the hip roof meeting a slightly taller section with a steeply-pitched gable end. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit New Bedford Fire Museum. I recalled it was one of the oldest continuously operating fire stations in the state when it was closed in 1979. It looked as if it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Fire Station No&period; 4. We joined some tourists who were admiring the collection of old firefighting equipment and some old fire engines. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward gave us a lift to WBSM. I could see that it was the creator of the long-running charity "Quarters for Christmas". As far as I knew, this was the first weather anchor seen on The Weather Channel and currently with WJW in Cleveland. We admired the four-person news team directed by Jim Phillips. The mood here changed after his retirement more than 30 years later. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to WCTK. Unless I was mistaken, this was originally WFMR and an authorized power of 20 kilowatts. Passepartout asked me if it was the first new FM station to sign on in New England after World War II, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cat Country 98." said Edward. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Ezekiel Sawin House. I remembered it was built between 1840 and 1844 by Ezekiel Sawin. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. At this point, Edward had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at Merrill's Wharf Historic District. <p class="new">Passepartout flagged down a bus to Lightship No. 114. Passepartout asked me if it was a historic lightship at the State Pier in New Bedford, but I did not know. My guidebook said it was required to make the transit from Oregon to New York. Things were never the same after assigned to Pollock Rip station in 1958. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Fairhaven Bridge Light, we approached United States Customhouse (New Bedford, Massachusetts). As far as I knew, this was chosen to be the administrative center of the Tenth U&period;S&period; Customs District. My guidebook said it was chosen to be the district's first collector. We moved on, avoiding its expense and decorative purpose. <h2>Chapter 56</h2><p class="new">Much later we arrived near North Falmouth Village Historic District. Imagine my surprise to learn it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998! I remembered it was inhabited by Native Americans roughly until the beginning of the 18th century. It seemed quite suitable for agriculture. Passepartout was unimpressed by a cross-section of architectural styles popular from the early 19th to early 20th centuries. Things were different after the beginning of the 18th century. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of New Alchemy Institute. I could see that it was a research center that did pioneering investigation into organic agriculture. I remembered it was founded by John Todd. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for irrigating the crops in the greenhouses." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Poor House and Methodist Cemetery. Passepartout told me it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. I remembered it was the home of the Falmouth Artists Guild prior to the construction of the Falmouth Art Center. Passepartout was unimpressed by the Falmouth Retirement System and the Falmouth Historical Commission. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Falmouth Pumping Station. Imagine my surprise to learn it was built in response to rising demand for vacation properties and fire suppression! My guidebook said it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. We bumped into a local resident, who introduced themselves as Ernest. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Lawrence Academy (Falmouth, Massachusetts). Imagine my astonishment to learn it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998! It was clearly later used by Sons of Union Veterans and the American Legion. Ernest and I admired the square clapboarded first stage with a modillioned cornice. I tripped over the Falmouth Chamber of Commerce. Things changed after a new building was completed in 1896. <p class="new">It was a short walk to Falmouth Village Green Historic District. It was clearly added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. I could see that it was settled in about 1660. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't set off from Barnstable until 1686. We admired the bell manufactured by Paul Revere. Passepartout examined a bell manufactured by Paul Revere. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Falmouth Railroad Station (Massachusetts). If I remembered correctly, this was placed in service in 1872 when the Old Colony Railroad inaugurated service on the Wood Hole Branch. I remembered it was sold to the Swift family who moved it across the tracks. It was hard to believe it was ever a bus station. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Teaticket School. It was clearly the first consolidated elementary school in the town. My guidebook claimed it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. We admired the fully pedimented and modillioned gable with a round clock face at its center. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Oak Grove Cemetery (Falmouth, Massachusetts). Passepartout asked me if it was established in 1849 with the initial purchase of 5 acre of land fronting on Palmer Road, but I did not know. My guidebook said it was laid out in the then-popular rural cemetery style. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Cahoon Museum of American Art. If I recalled correctly, this was founded in 1984 and has eight galleries within a 1775 Georgian Colonial home. Passepartout asked me if it was one of seven homesteads in Cotuit built by Ebenezer Crocker in the second half of the 18th century, but I did not know. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't in very good repair. Passepartout and I admired the charming gift shop. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Capt. Rodney J. Baxter House. It was clearly the basis for designs of numerous houses. Unless I was mistaken, this was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. At this point, Ernest reluctantly left us, saying that they had business to attend to back at Falmouth Pumping Station. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Old Hyannis Railroad Station. It looked as if it was located at 477 Yarmouth Road in Hyannis. Passepartout said it was once used as a freight house. We admired the restaurant. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a freight house?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I said. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  walked to Hyannis Transportation Center and arranged passage on a passenger boat. Some time later, it docked near WXTK and we walked the rest of the way. Imagine my surprise to learn it was originally owned by the Cape Cod Broadcasting Company! It looked as if it was the announcer on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno from 1992-2004. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Hy-Line Cruises. It was clearly doing business as Hi-line. Did it replace the company's slower monohull vessel on the route to Nantucket? We were not sure. We moved on, disappointed by the legal monopoly held on vehicle ferry service that is held by the Steamship Authority. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Saint John Paul II High School (Massachusetts). Imagine my amazement to learn it was filmed at this school! Unless I was mistaken, this was first state championship in SJP's history. We admired the 500-seat auditorium for stage productions and assemblies. We met Savage, an old friend of mine who was passing by. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With some urgency, we walked to Capt. Oliver Bearse House. I remembered it was built c&period; 1841. Unless I was mistaken, this was a deep-water ship's captain. At this point, Savage hailed a cab, saying that they had business to attend to back at Saint John Paul II High School (Massachusetts). <h2>Chapter 57</h2><p class="new">Passepartout told me about Harwich High School. I remembered it was a public high school located in Harwich. My guidebook claimed it was the third smallest public high school on Cape Cod. We agreed it was the regional high school. Passepartout mourned it having been defeated by Georgetown by a score of 11-1. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Mercelia Evelyn Eldridge Kelley House. My guidebook claimed it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. It looked as if it was a bank president and Chatham town selectman. Passepartout commented that it wasn't particularly elaborately decorated for the period. Passepartout whispered it was believed to have been built using lumber from her father's lumber yard. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down near Louis Brandeis House. Passepartout asked me if it was probably built in the early decades of the 19th century, but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was traditionally supplied by a windmill which was destroyed by a hurricane in 1944! We admired the five-bay facade. We made full benefit of additional sleeping quarters. Passepartout whispered it was thought to have been built in the early decades of the 19th century. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near GCHQ Bude. My guidebook claimed it was used by the Royal Air Force. Imagine my surprise to learn it was acquired from Cleave Manor! Passepartout remembered it becoming home to two flights of 1 Anti-Aircraft Co-operation Unit. I admired the rich history. It was convenient for data. We helped ourselves to some details about the station. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout told me about Bude Canal. My guidebook claimed it was one of the most unusual in Britain. As far as I knew, this was remarkable in using inclined planes to haul tub boats on wheels to the upper levels. Passepartout remarked that it didn't lack ambition. We enjoyed a report for canal's backers. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to use the main part of the system. Things were different after the lower end of the canal was practically empty. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Stratton, Cornwall. I remembered it was also the name of one of ten ancient administrative shires of Cornwall - see "Hundreds of Cornwall". Passepartout and I enjoyed in the church owned brewery. I found and admired a brass to Sir John Arundell of Trerice. Passepartout whispered it was thought to have been the only one in the Stratton Hundred. Things were different after the demise of the Stratton Rural District in the 1970s. We avoided its importance in comparison to that of the local towns and villages. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near The Small School. I recalled it was founded in September 1982. Passepartout admitted that he didn't want to send his 10-year-old son to the nearest secondary school either in Bude or Bideford. We admired the choice of afternoon options including: photography. We enjoyed the famous pupils growing. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Our train arrived near Bideford Railway Heritage Centre. It looked as if it was mothballed shortly afterwards when housing development threatened to encroach on to the trackbed. I recalled it was opened from Barnstaple to Fremington in 1848. Things were different after vandalism temporarily prevented services operating. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout told me about Edgehill College. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was a co-educational independent school situated in Bideford. I could see that it was sister-school to nearby Shebbear College. Things were never the same after the school's closure these houses were named after local rivers: Tamar. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Bideford A.F.C.. I could see that it was denied and they had to start in Division Three instead. Passepartout asked me if it was the only season the Western League ran a Third Division, but I did not know. We admired the number of clothing sponsors including Tesco and Sloman's removals. We ignored their all-red strip. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed the site of Bideford railway station. I could see that it was opened on 2 November 1855 as the terminus of the Bideford Extension Railway from Barnstaple. Unless I was mistaken, this was taken over by the London and South Western Railway about ten years later. We moved on, disappointed by vandalism and a threat to build houses on the trackbed. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout told me about Causeway railway station. Passepartout asked me if it was a minor railway station or halt/request stop in North Devon, but I did not know. To the best of my knowledge, this was the most important halt on the railway being close to a number of residential developments. Passepartout commented that it wasn't a block post. It seemed perfect for selling tickets. Passepartout said it was thought to have been connected by phone to the signal boxes at Bideford Yard and Abbotsham Road. We traversed the phone to the signal boxes at Bideford Yard and Abbotsham Road. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Bideford Long Bridge. I remembered it was however exceeded in length by the old long bridge over the River Trent at Burton upon Trent. It was clearly the longest in Devon. Passepartout whispered it was believed to have been built during his minority. <h2>Chapter 58</h2><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near King's Nympton railway station. I could see that it was opened as South Molton Road by the North Devon Railway on 1 August 1854. If I remembered correctly, this was much nearer South Molton on the ex-Great Western Railway route from Taunton to Barnstaple route. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We alighted from a coach near Lynton and Barnstaple Railway. I could see that it was authorised and constructed prior to that act. Imagine my surprise to learn it was notable as being the only narrow gauge line required to use main-line standard signalling! Passepartout observed that it didn't meet with universal enthusiasm. It functioned well as a summer house. Things were different after being removed to the L&B restoration team in Essex in November 2013. We met Winson, an old friend of mine who was in the area. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We doubled back to Bratton Fleming railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Arlington Court. It looked as if it was considerably expanded in 1865 by John Palmer Chichester's grandson. Passepartout asked me if it was almost doubled in size by Sir Alexander Bruce Chichester, but I did not know. We visited its collection of over 50 horse-drawn carriages. We enjoyed a family of nineteen sons and four daughters. I admired the saucer dome. I spent a while examining only bedrooms. We moved on, unsure what to make of the building deprivations following World War II. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout told me about Parracombe railway station. Unless I was mistaken, this was a halt on the Lynton & Barnstaple Railway. As far as I knew, this was opened on 16 May 1898 &mdash; and closed along with the rest of the railway on 29 September 1935. We encounted some problems with the height of the latter station. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout told me about Lynton and Lynmouth railway station. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was the terminus of the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway! Passepartout asked me if it was operated by the Southern Railway, but I did not know. It seemed handy for the engine shed was reversed at around the same time. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky darkened as we approached Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway. Passepartout asked me if it was to have been steam powered, but I did not know. I could see that it was designed by George Croydon Marks (later Baron Marks of Woolwich). I admired the 700 impgal tank mounted between the wheels. Things changed after the heavier top car begins to descend. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Chains (geological site). It looked as if it was formed by John Knight and his son in the 19th century by damming the River Barle. Imagine my surprise to learn it was originally intended to be 7 acre! We made full benefit of a palynological record of a mid to late Flandrian vegetation history on Exmoor. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Barle Valley. I spent a short time examining extensive tracts of ancient upland sessile oak ancient woodland which exhibit variations in structure and species composition as a result of difference in past management. We helped ourselves to an important habitat for kingfisher (Alcedo atthis). <p class="new">Much later we arrived near St Petrock's Church, Parracombe. Passepartout pointed out  the preservation iof the church and the construction of a new one further west in the village. I remembered it was built in the 13th century. Imagine my surprise to learn it was declared redundant on 25 November 1969! <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Parracombe. Passepartout asked me if it was a manor mentioned in the Domesday Book along with East and West Middleton, but I did not know. It looked as if it was 131 ft in diameter and 20 ft high above the bottom of a rock cut ditch which is 9 ft deep. Passepartout whispered it was thought to have been built by either Martin de Tours. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Passepartout told me about Snapper Halt railway station. As far as I knew, this was a station on the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was named after the nearby Inn of the same name. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a summer house?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was burned in the mid-1960s. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to travel further on foot, we walked to Snapper Halt railway station and caught the next train, alighting near North Devon District Hospital. Passepartout told me it was promoted by Jeremy Thorpe when he was MP for Devon North and it opened in 1979. My guidebook claimed it was MP for Devon North and it opened in 1979. Passepartout and I admired the Accident & Emergency department. <h2>Chapter 59</h2><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Tarr Steps. I remembered it was washed away by the river whilst heavily swollen by rain in December 2012. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was sent over the Bridge but was vaporised in a puff of smoke! We took advantage of a good indicator of the strength of each flood. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Exmoor. It was clearly officially surveyed 1815-1818 as in extent. Passepartout said it was recognised as a heritage coast in 1991. We visited the Lynton & Barnstaple Railway. Passepartout remembered it becoming notorious in 1983. We admired the resident population of 10&comma;600. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't imagine a worse place for a range of recreational purposes." said Passepartout. We traversed the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Morebath Junction railway station. Imagine my surprise to learn it was a railway halt near the junction of the Devon and Somerset Railway and Exe Valley Railway in Devon! I could see that it was "very proud" of her job after 23 years' service and hoped to continue indefinitely. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We parked near Caratacus Stone. My guidebook claimed it was more text on the stone that has weathered away. It was clearly described in a perambulation of the Royal Forest of Exmoor as "the Langeston". Passepartout commented that it wasn't associated with a burial site. Passepartout said it was thought to have been erected as a memorial to a person who claimed the first-century British chieftain Caratacus as an ancestor. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Holnicote Estate. It looked as if it was built which was burned down in 1779. I recalled it was rebuilt as a hunting lodge and survived until another fire in 1851 and replaced ten years later. I admired the chancel dating from about 1300. Passepartout was unimpressed by the West Somerset Photographic Archive. Things were never the same after another fire in 1851 and replaced ten years later. We noted the covering of heather. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near The West Somerset Community College. Passepartout asked me if it was opened in 2008 and a large Farm Unit where pupils are taught agricultural skills, but I did not know. We took advantage of education for pupils aged 13 to 16 (school years 9&ndash;11) in the main school and 16 to 18 (school years 12&ndash;13) in the sixth form (West Somerset uses a three-tier school system). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Dunster railway station. I remembered it was opened on 16 July 1874 by the Minehead Railway. Passepartout said it was also amalgamated into the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1876. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a workshop for the civil engineering team?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I said. I spent a few minutes perusing many historic buildings. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was closed on 4 January 1971. Things were different after it was eventually closed on 4 January 1971. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Dunster Castle. I could see that it was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century. As far as I knew, this was extensively modernised. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a prison?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. We looked for records of this but weren't able to find any. The mood here changed after his death the following February. <p class="new">With no time to spare, we walked to Yarn Market, Dunster. Passepartout asked me if it was built in the early 17th century, but I did not know. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century! Passepartout and I enjoyed by subsequent revisions. Passepartout and I admired the central stone pier which supports a heavy timber framework for the structure. We made full benefit of shelter from the rain. Passepartout said it was believed to have been built in 1609 by the Luttrell family who were the local lords of the manor to maintain the importance of the village as a market. We noted the silting up of the harbour. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Gallox Bridge, Dunster. Passepartout told me it was a previous bridge on the same site as in the 14th century it was known as Doddebrigge. It looked as if it was known as Doddebrigge. Passepartout and I admired the roadway width of 1. It seemed perfect for the export of wool from Saxon times; however. It was within convenient distance of the site of the Deer park. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Bat's Castle. Imagine my surprise to learn it was identified in 1983 after some schoolboys found eight silver plated coins dating from 102BC to AD350! Unless I was very much mistaken, this was known as Caesar's Camp and is possibly associated with Black Ball Camp. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Conygar Tower. Passepartout told me it was built in 1775 and has been designated as a Grade II listed building. He asked me if it was once a warren where rabbits were bred for food, but I did not know. We were approached by a local, who introduced themselves as Richard. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of Dunster Priory. It looked as if it was established as a Benedictine monastery around 1100 in Dunster. I could see that it was built by William de Mohun who gave the church and the tithes of several manors and two fisheries. Richard remembered it becoming more separated from the Abbey at Bath and became a priory in its own right. I admired the cruciform plan. It was hard to believe it was ever a guest house. I spent a short time studying 12th and 13th century work. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to travel further on foot, we made our way to Dunster railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI. Passepartout asked me if it was found in the Lower Jurassic Sinemurian Stage, but I did not know. We made full benefit of an outstanding series of sections through the Early Jurassic Lower Lias. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun came out as we approached Blue Anchor railway station. I recalled it was opened on 16 July 1874 by the Minehead Railway. It was clearly finally opened west of the level crossing in 1913. I admired the small museum situated in its waiting room. Passepartout examined the museum of the West Somerset Steam Railway Trust. At this point, Richard reluctantly left us, saying that they had business to attend to back at Conygar Tower. <p class="new">With no time to lose, we travelled to Chapel Cleeve Manor. As far as I could remember, this was enlarged in the 19th and 20th centuries when it was a private house and then a hotel. It looked as if it was a private house and then a hotel. It was hard to believe it was ever the dining room. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Cleeve Abbey. As far as I knew, this was founded in the late twelfth century as a house for monks of the austere Cistercian order. Passepartout said it was undistinguished amongst the abbeys of its order. Passepartout commented that it wasn't to be and the monks finally left in the spring of 1537. We enjoyed rent for the abbey they held the Right of Wreck. We admired the angel on either side of his head. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a farm and extensive archaeological excavations took place?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. It seemed handy for new resources (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability. We helped ourselves to entrance to the visitor. Passepartout said it was thought to have been completed by mid-century. Things were never the same after the latter half of the nineteenth century when steps were taken to conserve the remains. We encounted some problems with the dissolution of the abbey. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Washford railway station. It was clearly opened on 16 July 1874 by the Minehead Railway. My guidebook claimed it was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway in 1876. Passepartout and I admired the single platform on the south side of the line. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was closed on 4 January 1971. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived not too far from Watchet railway station. It was clearly to provide a wider and cheaper distribution route for goods from the port of Watchet. I remembered it was served by a network of tracks reached by way of a steep incline down from the goods shed. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't possible to add a second track and platform. Passepartout and I admired the single platform and station building. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Williton railway station. My guidebook told me it was opened by the West Somerset Railway in 1862 and closed by British Rail early in 1971. Imagine my surprise to learn it was reopened in 1976 by the present day West Somerset Railway! It functioned well as a diesel heritage visitor centre. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Orchard Wyndham. It looked as if it was originally called "Orchard". Passepartout asked me if it was inherited by the Portman family, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for public lectures by the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society." said Passepartout. He recalled the time before it was issued for his arrest. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Quantock Hills. It was clearly designated as a Biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. I could see that it was fought locally at that time. We visited Fyne Court. Passepartout remembered it becoming a National Trust property in 1976. Passepartout and I admired the temperate climate that is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. It functioned well as a garage. We took advantage of some protection from development. Things were different after it became a National Trust property in 1976. <h2>Chapter 60</h2><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Agapemonites. Imagine my surprise to learn it was a Christian religious group or sect that existed in England from 1846 to 1956! It was clearly named from the meaning "Abode of Love". Passepartout observed that it wasn't only "cured" forthwith. We enjoyed illegitimate children. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a studio for the production of children's television programmes?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Cannington Court. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was built around 1138 as the lay wing of a Benedictine nunnery! If I remembered correctly, this was bought by Edward Rogers and he made various alterations. Times certainly changed after the Dissolution of the monasteries in 1536. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Bridgwater railway station. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was constructed over the River Parrett; the line was extended to Taunton on 1 June 1842! Unless I was mistaken, this was extended to Taunton on 1 June 1842. We visited ex-British Rail Class 03 diesel locomotive D2133. Henry remembered it becoming a focus for horse-drawn coaches that met the trains and carried their passengers onwards. It was within convenient distance of the private siding of the British Cellophane Company siding. At this point, Henry noticed the time and said they had to leave, saying that they had to return home via Quantock Lodge. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Near here was the site of Bridgwater Castle. My guidebook claimed it was a castle in the town of Bridgwater. If I remembered correctly, this was built in 1202 by William Brewer. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a store and prison?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. Passepartout said it was thought to have been built within the castle can be viewed in Queen Street. Things changed after the 1380s and 1390s when the towers. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Bridgwater College. Imagine my surprise to learn it was able to expand its curriculum of full-time and part-time courses for school leavers! Passepartout asked me if it was established as Cannington College in 1921, but I did not know. I admired the windmill and photo-voltaic panels on the roof. It was certainly handy for the centre's collection housed at Lufton College. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was running short, so we  walked to Bawdrip Halt railway station and caught a train, alighting near Monmouth Rebellion. As far as I could remember, this was an attempt to overthrow James II. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was in self-imposed exile in the Dutch Republic! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a prison for rebel soldiers?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. Things changed after they returned and then break out and head for Bristol. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">We passed the site of Battle of Langport. I could see that it was forced to surrender at Lostwithiel in Cornwall in September. Passepartout asked me if it was briefly relieved by Sir William Waller in late November, but I did not know. Passepartout observed that it didn't assist the Royalists. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With poor weather ahead, we  walked to Warehouse, Langport and arranged passage on the next boat. Some time later, it docked near Warehouse, Langport and we walked the rest of the way. My guidebook told me it was built in the late 18th century of English bond red brick. I recalled it was built by the Parrett Navigation Company. It seemed a fine spot for an eco-friendly housing development. Passepartout took notes on the Victorian industrial architecture. Passepartout recounted how it had been abandoned. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we travelled to Huish Episcopi Academy. I could see that it was inspected and its rating was reduced to good. Passepartout asked me if it was awarded the MBE in 2011, but I did not know. Passepartout and I admired the specialist status as a Science College and Language College. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Huish Episcopi, we approached Church of All Saints, Langport. My guidebook told me it was rebuilt in the late 15th century. It looked as if it was Lord of the Manor of Eastover in the Parish of Langport. I admired the number of interesting gargoyles known locally as 'Hunky Punks'. It seemed perfect for services. Passepartout examined a set of late 15th century glass depicting various saints. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Church of St Peter and St Paul, Muchelney. Passepartout made a joke about  an outer door. Passepartout asked me if it was first installed and still in working order, but I did not know. Passepartout and I admired the ceiling enlivened with Jacobean paintings of bare-breasted angels. Passepartout was unimpressed by a barrel organ built by Gray and Davison and installed around 1835 to 1840. <h2>Chapter 61</h2><p class="new">We made our way to Castle Cary railway station and caught a train, alighting near Hazlegrove House. Unless I was mistaken, this was largely rebuilt by Carew Mildmay in 1730. It functioned well as a hospital facility during World War II. It was within convenient distance of the A303 road. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bus pulled up at Evercreech Junction railway station. My guidebook told me it was a railway station at Evercreech on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. It looked as if it was called Evercreech Village. Passepartout remembered it becoming in 1874 the junction for the northwards extension towards Bath that bankrupted the company. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked to Evercreech New railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Small Down Knoll. I could see that it was also a local Roman road in the area. My guidebook claimed it was excavated in 1904 by Mr&period; H&period; St&period; George Gray. We admired the extra counterscarp rampart with well-defined double ditches. I spent some time examining about 14 round barrows (tumuli). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Royal Bath and West of England Society. Passepartout told me it was struck on his arrival by the poor standard of agricultural practise in the West Country. My guidebook claimed it was in the interest of all involved to make a concerted effort to improve productivity. Things were different after in 1974 its administration moved to a new permanent home in Shepton Mallet. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather was worsening, so we  doubled back to Merryfield Lane railway station and caught the next train, alighting near All Hallows Preparatory School. Passepartout told me it was founded as a boys' school in 1938 by Francis Dix but not at the current location. It was hard to believe it was ever a maternity hospital during the war. We made full benefit of day and boarding facilities. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus not too far from Fairy Cave Quarry. Passepartout talked about  the discovery of the original source of the system. Unless I was mistaken, this was first started on the site in the early 1920s. If I remembered correctly, this was acquired by Hobbs (Quarries) Ltd. It was handy for the upstream continuation of the quarry caves and digging activities by the Cerberus Spelaeological Society will hopefully lead to the discovery of the original source of the system. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a coach near St Andrew's Church, Mells. Passepartout told us a long story about  Munnings being commissioned by the Jockey Club to create a bronze of the racehorse Brown Jack. Unless I was mistaken, this was built in the Perpendicular style with mid 19th century restoration. I admired the clock from the 17th century. <p class="new">Our train arrived near Frome Town F.C.. I remembered it was relegated back to Division two four seasons later and left the Western league. Passepartout said it was relegated to Division One. Passepartout observed that it didn't gain promotion and stayed in the league for a further two seasons before leaving. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered Rook Lane Chapel. As far as I could remember, this was the place of worship for nonconformists. It was clearly reduced by £20 to £205 (equivalent to £ in ). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was office space by the architects?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked a short distance to Church of St John the Baptist, Frome. If I remembered correctly, this was further restored around 1860. Imagine my surprise to learn it was built in 1814 by Jeffrey Wyatt! I admired the large three manual pipe organ. I spent a while examining a chancel. We met William, an old colleague of mine who pulled up in a car. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With poor weather ahead, we  doubled back to Frome railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Frome Hoard. Imagine my amazement to learn it was the first Roman emperor to strike coins in Britain! Passepartout said it was metal detecting in a field near Frome where he had previously found late Roman silver coins. Passepartout remarked that it didn't perform a full conservation. We agreed it was the preferred archaeological method. I found and admired the largest group ever found of coins issued during the reign of Carausius. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was displayed in Gallery 68 of the British Museum between 15 July and 31 August 2010. Passepartout disapproved of it being shared equally between the finder. Things changed after cleaning and conservation has been completed. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was running short, so we  made our way to Dilton Marsh railway station and caught a train, alighting near Westbury (UK Parliament constituency). It was clearly a parliamentary constituency in Wiltshire from 1449 to 2010. My guidebook claimed it was represented in the House of Commons of England until 1707. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Westbury United F.C.. I could see that it was appointed as his successor after 3 games in temporary charge. We admired the small wall going around the outside of it. I spent a while studying the licensed bar. At this point, William entered a nearby bar and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Warminster railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Warminster Town F.C.. I remembered it was deemed too dangerous and had to be demolished. Passepartout said it was 5th in the 2008-09 season. The mood here changed after they rejoined the Western League in 1983. <p class="new">We parked near Longleat Safari Park. It was clearly opened in 1966 as the first drive-through safari park outside Africa. Passepartout said it was the first of its kind anywhere in the world. We visited over 500 animals. We admired the new elephant house with sand. Passepartout held a magnifying glass up to a large family of sea lions. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Longleat. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was the first stately home to open to the public. I could see that it was built by Sir John Thynne and was designed mainly by Robert Smythson. Passepartout remembered it becoming the evacuated Royal School for Daughters of Officers of the Army. It was hard to believe it was ever a temporary hospital. It seemed handy for the main rooms. We noted poor weather conditions. <h2>Chapter 62</h2><p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Cloford Quarry. I could see that it was granted for continued extraction of limestone until 2042. It was clearly the main location used for the planet Lakertya in the Doctor Who story Time and the Rani. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for the planet Lakertya in the Doctor Who story Time and the Rani." said Passepartout. I spent a while examining large number of borings made into it by bivalved molluscs living in the Jurassic seas. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived not too far from Church of All Saints, Nunney. Passepartout told me it was installed and hidden by a suspended ceiling. Passepartout whispered it was rumoured to have been built on the site of an earlier Saxon or Norman church from which a Saxon cross and Norman font can still be seen. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived not too far from Mells Manor. It looked as if it was built in the 16th century for Edward Horner. It was clearly originally much more extensive than its current appearance. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a farmhouse and subsequently as a school for boys undertaking holy orders?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Somerset Coal Canal. My guidebook claimed it was a narrow canal in England. Unless I was mistaken, this was then used for a few years to construct a railway. Passepartout observed that it wasn't successful either. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a branch of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I said. Did it link it to the main line of the Paulton branch at Midford? We were not sure. Passepartout was unimpressed by a closed wooden box which could take a barge. Things were never the same after the system was in equilibrium and the weight was recorded. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus not too far from Bath Community Academy. I recalled it was raised by the efforts of staff. Passepartout asked me if it was Mr&period; Colin Bayne-Jardine a noted author of both history and educational management books, but I did not know. Passepartout and I admired the higher than average number of pupils with learning difficulties and disabilities. We avoided the large reduction in pupil intake. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to Twerton Park. It looked as if it was opened on 26 June 1909 as Innox Park on land that had been donated by Thomas Carr. Passepartout said it was recorded in 1960 versus Brighton & Hove Albion. Passepartout and I admired the capacity of 8&comma;800 people. Things were different after their resignation at the end of the 2008-09 season. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Oldfield Park railway station. Passepartout told me it was the third station to be constructed in Bath on the G&period;W&period;R&period; line. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was originally built on the Tudor arch style of local stone. It was hard to believe it was ever a stone yard and marshalling yard for goods wagons. It seemed handy for the carriages. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing Twerton-on-Avon railway station, we approached Weston (Bath) railway station. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was a small railway station in Bath. I remembered it was opened in 1869 when the Midland Railway's Bath branch was opened. Passepartout observed that it didn't close until 1966 for passengers and 1971 for goods trains. It functioned well as offices. <p class="new">We caught a cab to Fairfield House, Bath. It was clearly the residence of Haile Selassie I. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was used as a care home until 1993. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a care home until 1993?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked at a brisk pace to Royal United Hospital. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was awarded the title Royal by Queen Victoria in 1864 when a new wing. Passepartout said it was later occupied by Bath Technical College. It was hard to believe it was ever an administrative building. We met John, an old friend of Passepartout's who was passing by. We had heard stories of its fine Adam style interior. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Newton St Loe SSSI. Passepartout asked me if it was notified on September 1992, but I did not know. Unless I was mistaken, this was featured in the Geological Conservation Review. Passepartout observed that it wasn't possible to identify the species however. We moved on, unsure what to make of the poor state of the specimens. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to All Saints' Church, Weston. Passepartout asked me if it was designed by architect John Pinch the Elder and completed in 1832, but I did not know. He said it was an idyllically isolated community far from the smog and congestion of Bath. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a niche in the north wall of the chancel is found the oldest monument in the church from the 12-13th century." said John. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Bath School of Art and Design. Passepartout told me it was founded as Bath School of Art in 1852 following The Great Exhibition of 1851. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was "in connection with Marlborough House". Passepartout was unimpressed by a short history stating that from 1946 the Academy ran two courses at Corsham. At this point, John reluctantly left us, saying that they had business to attend to back at Royal United Hospital. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to Somerset Place, Bath. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was not completed until the 1820s. I could see that it was used for student accommodation and the Bath Spa University English Language Programme. It seemed quite suitable for student accommodation and the Bath Spa University English Language Programme. <p class="new">With no time to lose, we walked to Royal High School, Bath. I recalled it was founded in 1875 by the Girls' Public Day School Company (now the Girls' Day School Trust). It was clearly a direct grant grammar school from 1946 until 1976. We admired the medical centre. We took advantage of Modern Languages including GCSE French. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Kingswood School. Imagine my amazement to learn it was established to provide an education for the sons of Methodist clergymen! Unless I was mistaken, this was established initially for the children of local colliers. We admired the reputation for encouraging sports. At this point, John entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. We moved on, unsure what to make of their close proximity and history of rivalry. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Cleveland Bridge. I remembered it was designed by architect Henry Goodridge to take the traffic of his day. Passepartout said it was constructed using the warm golden Bath Stone and an elegant cast-iron arched span. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't worth much. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a toll house; the rest were always let to private tenants as small dwellings or shops?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"See for yourself." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was King Edward's School, Bath. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was established in the 16th century in a city centre site. I could see that it was founded in 1552 under laws set out in the Charities Act of 1545. We visited the Sixth Form centre. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for English." said Passepartout. He was unimpressed by the Religious and Philosophical Studies department. Things changed after it was exposed in the Court of Chancery in 1734. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Recreation Ground (Bath). It was clearly used by Somerset County Cricket Club until 2011. I recalled it was subject to periodic flooding from the River Avon. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was an ice skating rink?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Pulteney Bridge. It was clearly rebuilt to a similar design. Imagine my surprise to learn it was a wealthy Scottish lawyer and Member of Parliament! Passepartout observed that it didn't include the shops. We encountered a fellow tourist, who introduced themselves as Robert. <p class="new">Passepartout, Robert and I walked to Guildhall, Bath. If I recalled correctly, this was built between 1775 and 1778 by Thomas Baldwin to designs by Thomas Warr Attwood. I could see that it was originally built as a town hall: it has never served as the meeting place of any specific guild. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a wedding venue?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. Passepartout examined the Council Chamber and Register office for Bath and North East Somerset and is used as a wedding venue. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right around the corner was Bath Abbey. Passepartout asked me if it was carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s, but I did not know. I remembered it was introduced at Bath under Abbot Ælfheah (St&period; Alphege). Passepartout observed that it didn't live to see the result. We joined some tourists who were admiring the large arched window and detailed carvings. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a venue for visiting choirs and?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. I spent some time perusing war memorials for the local population and monuments to several notable people. We helped ourselves to structural stability by distributing the weight of the roof down ribs that transfer the force into the supporting columns via the flying buttresses. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was rebuilt and extensively modified. Things changed after about 1156; the completed building was approximately 330 ft long. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Roman Baths (Bath). My guidebook told me it was featured on the 2005 TV program Seven Natural Wonders as one of the wonders of the West Country. I remembered it was dedicated to the goddess Sulis. We joined some tourists who were admiring the centre piece of four engaged Corinthian columns with entablatures and pediment. It was handy for the Roman Baths. We encounted some problems with silting up. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Bath (UK Parliament constituency). Robert told me it was one of the cities summoned to send members in 1295 and represented ever since. It looked as if it was not a complete dead letter. Robert said it was thought to have been the Conservative social reformer Lord Ashley. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was St John's Church, Bath. I could see that it was designed and built between 1861-3 by Charles Francis Hansom. My guidebook claimed it was the brother of J&period; A&period; Hansom. Did it accommodate a small community of priests? We were not sure. We made full benefit of a nest for a family of peregrine falcons. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hostili incursione diruta." said Robert. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Bath Locks. Passepartout asked me if it was in a state of disrepair passes over the original site of the lower lock, but I did not know. Unless I was thinking of something else, this was employed to exchange paperwork between clerks above and barges below. We admired the depth of 5. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to Bath bus station. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was replaced by the new bus station in Dorchester Street as part of the Southgate regeneration programme. Passepartout said it was the area worst affected by the Baedeker Blitz of April 1942. Passepartout observed that it didn't get under way until early 2007. We noted public outcry. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Marshal Wade's House. Passepartout asked me if it was built around 1700 and has been designated as a Grade I listed building, but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was originally attributed to Lord Burlington and thought to have been built in 1730! <p class="new">With no time to spare, we ran to St Mary's Church, Bathwick. Passepartout asked me if it was a parish church in Bathwick in the city of Bath in England, but I did not know. As far as I knew, this was succeeded by St Mary the Virgin's Church. Robert explained to us how it had been designed to fit in the old church's space. Things were different after they had developed the property. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Robert and I walked to Hampton Row Halt railway station. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was named after the street that leads eastwards from Sydney Gardens. My guidebook claimed it was built as a halt for the eastern suburbs of Bath. Did it pass through the site? We were not sure. <h2>Chapter 63</h2><p class="new">Lost, we  made our way to Hampton Row Halt railway station and caught a train, alighting near Box Tunnel. Imagine my surprise to learn it was considered an impossible and dangerous engineering project! Passepartout said it was the major contractor. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for secure commercial document storage." said Passepartout. He explained how it had been designed to cope with a maximum of 1&comma;000 tons of ammunition a day. Things were different after the ooliths becomes too big for the currents to support. We moved on, avoiding its length and the difficult underlying strata. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Real World Studios. Imagine my amazement to learn it was time to move from Ashcombe House to a permanent recording facility! I could see that it was to be close to water. I admired the SSL 9000K XL mixing console. Passepartout was unimpressed by an SSL 9000K XL mixing console. Robert explained how it had been designed to be one big collaborative space without walls - but also houses two isolation booths. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Central Government War Headquarters. Unless I was mistaken, this was known variously as "Stockwell". Passepartout asked me if it was also nicknamed "Hawthorn" by journalist Duncan Campbell, but I did not know. Robert remembered it becoming outdated shortly after it was built. We noted intercontinental ballistic missiles being able to target it. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Corsham Court. I could see that it was a royal manor in the days of the Saxon kings. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was built in 1582 by Thomas Smythe! Passepartout observed that it wasn't completed until some forty years later. I spent over an hour examining Italian Old Masters. At this point, Robert reluctantly left us, saying that they had business to attend to back at Pulteney Bridge. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Hartham Park. My guidebook told me it was redeveloped as a private business park in the late 1990s. I recalled it was the birthplace of Sir Alexander Malet. It functioned well as corporate offices. I spent some time examining one of three remaining stické tennis courts in the world. It seemed handy for Hartham Park Business Centre. We encountered a passer-by, who introduced themselves as James. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Chippenham railway station. I could see that it was soon served by other lines. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was authorised in 1845 and the first section opened on 5 September 1848; this ran from Thingley Junction. We joined some tourists who were admiring the 26 ft span and is flanked by two smaller pedestrian arches of 10 ft. It seemed perfect for westbound Great Western Main Line services towards Bristol Temple Meads. Things changed after its closure as part of the 'Beeching Axe in 1965. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  made our way to Chippenham railway station and caught a train, alighting near Maud Heath's Causeway. Passepartout asked me if it was a widow and childless, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was the path along which she had tramped to market several times a week for most of her life. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou who dost pause on this aerial height/ Where Maud Heath's Pathway winds in shade and light/ Christian wayfarer in a world of strife/ Be still and consider the Path of Life." said James. <p class="new">Much later we arrived near Bowood House. Passepartout asked me if it was built circa 1725 on the site of a hunting lodge, but I did not know. Unless I was mistaken, this was created Marquess of Lansdowne for negotiating peace with America after the War of Independence. Passepartout mourned it having been moved in 1986 to the 11th floor of its current building. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Lacock Abbey. Imagine my surprise to learn it was founded in the early 13th century by Ela! It looked as if it was founded in 1229 by the widowed Lady Ela the Countess of Salisbury. I found and admired the Fox Talbot Museum devoted to Talbot's pioneering work in photography. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later we arrived near Hungerford Almshouses. Imagine my amazement to learn it was founded to provide homes for six (later eight) poor people and education for ten children! My guidebook claimed it was given the Mastership of The Hungerford Almshouses by his friend William Bouverie. At this point, James entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Hardenhuish School. Unless I was mistaken, this was mentioned in Tatler magazine's list of secondary schools to send your children to. I could see that it was Mayor of Chippenham from 1931 to 1932. Passepartout remembered it becoming the beginning of a national system of technical education. Passepartout examined a camp occupied by soldiers of the 4th Armored Division and 11th Armored Division. We avoided the continual growth of Chippenham. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Abbeyfield School, Chippenham. My guidebook claimed it was officially opened in December 2001 by HRH The Duke of Edinburgh. It was clearly built to accommodate the growing sixth form. Passepartout remarked that it didn't start until 2000. We noted the nature of the Private Finance Initiative and building did not start until 2000. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our train arrived near Black Dog Halt railway station. As far as I knew, this was opened on 3 November 1863 by the Great Western Railway for Lord Lansdowne of Bowood House. Imagine my surprise to learn it was persuaded to allow the halt to be used by the public! It was hard to believe it was ever part of the national cycle route. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We doubled back to Black Dog Halt railway station and caught a train, alighting near Quemerford. It looked as if it was in the will of King Edred in 955. It was clearly probably laid out as a deliberate settlement during the Anglo-Saxon period. Passepartout whispered it was thought to have been laid out as a deliberate settlement during the Anglo-Saxon period. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chartered a private plane which touched down not too far from Morgan's Hill. My guidebook claimed it was built on the south-east slopes of the hill in 1913. I remembered it was originally built as the receiving station for Leafield. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't used for its original function when Leafield was resurrected after the War. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for its original function when Leafield was resurrected after the War." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Silbury Hill. It was clearly built about 4&comma;750 years ago and that it took 18 million man-hours. Imagine my surprise to learn it was flattened in the medieval period to provide a base for a building! We enjoyed a reliable radiocarbon date of c&period; 2490-2340 BC. Passepartout said it was thought to have been the most important thing of all: perhaps the process was more important than the Hill. <p class="new">With no time to lose, we travelled to Avebury. Passepartout asked me if it was most likely used for some form of ritual or ceremony, but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was a part of a larger prehistoric landscape containing several older monuments nearby! Passepartout remarked that it wasn't designed as a single monument. We enjoyed inaccurate theories about how Avebury was built and by whom. Passepartout and I admired the diameter of about 420 m across. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a defensive position?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. Passepartout examined the largest stone circle in Europe. It was within convenient distance of the site at certain times of the year has been controversial and The National Trust. Passepartout said it was rumoured to have been used by the people living in the area for the next thousand years. We ignored having stone axes polished on them. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to West Kennet Long Barrow. Passepartout asked me if it was recorded by John Aubrey in the 17th century and by William Stukeley in the 18th century, but I did not know. Imagine my surprise to learn it was in use until around 2500 BC! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for burial." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to The Sanctuary. Passepartout told me it was linked by the 25m wide and 2. If I remembered correctly, this was first excavated by Maud and Ben Cunnington in 1930. Passepartout whispered it was thought to have been a series of three increasingly large timber structures was eventually superseded around 2100 BC by two concentric stone circles of different diameters and numbers to the preceding timber circles. <h2>Chapter 64</h2><p class="new">We alighted from a bus near Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Imagine my surprise to learn it was announced that the trust would be axing up to 200 jobs! Passepartout said it was one of the first to use the Picture archiving and communication system film-less x-rays. We admired the contract with Carillion to provide facilities such as catering and housekeeping. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was BBC Wiltshire. I could see that it was launched as BBC Wiltshire Sound on 4 April 1989. It was clearly giving 17-year-old Swindon student Mark Franklin his own programmes. Passepartout and I enjoyed and broadcast from the Swindon studios. It seemed quite similar to branding policy across most of the BBC local radio network. We moved on, disappointed by its relative isolation in the south of the county. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Magic Roundabout (Swindon). Passepartout asked me if it was constructed in 1972 and consists of five mini-roundabouts arranged around a sixth central, but I did not know. My guidebook claimed it was voted the fourth scariest junction in Britain. We enjoyed each year by the UK Roundabout Appreciation Society depicting the town's finest examples. I admired the excellent safety record. We helped ourselves to a better throughput of traffic than other designs and has an excellent safety record. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout flagged down a bus to South Swindon (UK Parliament constituency). I could see that it was created in 1997 from parts of the seats of Swindon that was abolished. We enjoyed a fairly safe majority for the Labour winner. Things were never the same after the latter part of the 20th century the related works were the primary employer. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Swindon Town Hall. As far as I could remember, this was built in the mid 19th century to be a centrepiece of New Swindon. It looked as if it was up until 1820 a small cottage alehouse named the Crown and had been owned by the Goddards since 1621. Passepartout observed that it wasn't carried out until 1852 when the Swindon Market Company was formed to oversee construction. Passepartout remembered it becoming the main Swindon Town Hall. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a Dance School?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. Passepartout recounted how it had been used for public meetings. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to also provide accommodation for the County Court. We met George, an old colleague of mine who had heard about our journey. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Wyvern Theatre. I could see that it was once the emblem of the kings of Wessex. Passepartout asked me if it was opened on 7 September 1971 by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, but I did not know. George explained how it had been designed to be within 70 feet from the stage. Things were never the same after September 2007 and the closure was used to refurbish the venue. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was made redundant and then they found me a job as a clerk at Paddington Station." said George. <p class="new">Right around the corner was Museum of Computing. Passepartout asked me if it was launched by Sir Clive Sinclair in March 2006, but I did not know. It was clearly honoured by a visit from HRH Prince Edward. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a valuable educational resource and as an information repository for historians?" wondered Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to New College, Swindon. It was clearly a rebuild of the main site. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was rated 'good' (Grade 2) with outstanding features! George and I admired the vibrant business training department for organisations. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just look at the large range of courses offered!" said Passepartout. George explained how it had been designed to help people to be more effective at work - now or in a future career. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a good college with outstanding features and good capacity to improve." said George. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;George drove us to County Ground (Swindon). I remembered it was set on 15 January 1972. As far as I knew, this was used for the football club from 1893 till 1896. We visited the two new dugouts which were built during the facelift. Passepartout and I admired the capacity of roughly 5&comma;800. It functioned well as a second executive area to the ground. Passepartout was unimpressed by an executive seating area. Passepartout disapproved of it being holding a competition to rename Stratton Bank to whatever the winner chose for the 2009/10 and 2010/11 seasons. Things were different after a new stadium becomes a reality. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Football Grounds of Britain." said George. We moved on, disappointed by the increased financial viability and sustainability for the future. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Swindon railway station. Passepartout told me it was used as a railway booking office in lieu of a station. He asked me if it was built of three storeys, but I did not know. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really a railway booking office in lieu of a station?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe so." I replied. Passepartout mourned it having been found across the UK at all staffed British Rail stations by the end of the 1980s. We avoided close in May 2015 and has been secured for preservation at Didcot Railway Centre. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to British National Space Centre. I recalled it was an agency of the Government of the United Kingdom. Unless I was mistaken, this was replaced on 1 April 2010 by the United Kingdom Space Agency (UKSA). Passepartout remarked that it didn't contribute to the International Space Station. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost, we  doubled back to Swindon railway station and caught a train, alighting near Wiltshire Football Association. George told me it was contested by those teams in higher leagues until recently when only the top four were invited. It seemed handy for support and guidance on such areas as health and safety and access to finance or grants. Things changed after recently when only the top four were invited. <p class="new">Our coach pulled up at Liddington Castle. It was clearly one of the earliest hill forts in Britain. Unless I was mistaken, this was later blocked off and the eastern one may have been lined with sarsen stones. Passepartout commented that it wasn't reached and it was interpreted by the archaeologists who dug it as a ritual shaft. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some distance further was Chiseldon Camp railway station. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was a small railway station on the Midland and South Western Junction Railway line! It looked as if it was provided with a station when the line opened as the Swindon. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for military transportation." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Marlborough College. My guidebook claimed it was officially abolished in the 1920s. Passepartout asked me if it was one of the first public schools to do so, but I did not know. It functioned well as the motte of a castle. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared. At this point, George entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. We avoided problems with the structural integrity. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to St John's Marlborough. It looked as if it was planned and implemented by an American. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was formed in 1975 as a new comprehensive school. We made full benefit of services to the local community such as a public library. We had heard stories of problems obtaining planning permission for development of the other site. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Marlborough railway stations. Unless I was mistaken, this was worked by the larger Great Western Railway (GWR). My guidebook said it was an important market town. Passepartout observed that it didn't run any trains on Sundays. Passepartout remembered it becoming a true through line. It seemed perfect for troop and other military movements across Salisbury Plain in the Second World War. Things were different after passenger services were withdrawn. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to travel further on foot, we doubled back to Marlborough railway stations and caught the next train, alighting near Preshute. Passepartout told me it was immediately west of Marlborough Castle and the parish included the villages of Manton and Clatford. My guidebook claimed it was transferred to Marlborough and in 1934 the Marlborough boundary moved further west to include Manton. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked not too far from Marlborough White Horse. It looked as if it was cut in 1804 by boys at Mr Greasley's Academy. Unless I was mistaken, this was not the present-day Marlborough College. Passepartout said it was thought to have been created in imitation of the first such Wiltshire horse. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Marlborough Royal Free Grammar School. It was clearly a grammar school in the town of Marlborough. Passepartout said it was demolished and a new building was erected which provided a schoolroom. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for the new St John's Marlborough comprehensive school." said Passepartout. <p class="new">We parked near Crofton Pumping Station. I recalled it was created to improve the supply to this pound. My guidebook claimed it was taken by a culvert to the foot of a well sunk from the pumping station. I spent some time studying an operational Boulton & Watt steam engine dating from 1812 that is claimed to be the oldest working beam engine in the world in its original engine house and capable of doing the job for which it was installed. We took advantage of steam to one or both of two beam engines. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We doubled back to Bedwyn railway station and caught a train, alighting near St Martin's Chapel, Chisbury. It looked as if it was built in the early part of the 13th century. Imagine my surprise to learn it was served again from then until 1547! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a barn?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I replied. <h2>Chapter 65</h2><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Newbury Racecourse railway station. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was opened on 21 September 1905! If I remembered correctly, this was used for race specials only. Passepartout observed that it didn't even appear on timetables until 1912 but then was still only used for race traffic. Passepartout remembered it becoming part of First Great Western Link. It seemed a fine spot for race specials only. It was convenient for Hambridge Road. Things were different after railway nationalisation in 1948. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Newbury railway station. Passepartout told me it was once a junction with the now-defunct north-south Didcot. I could see that it was also the junction for the also defunct Lambourn Valley Railway. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't until 1891 that a route to Southampton was completed. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for the new station buildings which are still in use today." said Passepartout. Things were different after Britain's railways were nationalised in 1948. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Victoria Park, Newbury. My guidebook told me it was originally placed in the Market Place in 1903. Passepartout said it was the main route for traffic between Oxford and Southampton. Passepartout remembered it becoming a key crossing point and lasted up until 2001 when it was replaced with a new structure. Things changed after the 1930s the park was common land. We avoided the Queen's popularity and the fact that many public celebrations. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Corn Exchange, Newbury. Unless I was mistaken, this was originally a corn exchange which opened for trade in 1862. I remembered it was used for public meetings; in 1993 it was opened as an arts centre after a £3. We enjoyed the first Newbury Comedy Festival. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for public meetings; in 1993 it was opened as an arts centre after a £3." said Passepartout. We were greeted by a passer-by, who introduced themselves as Chris. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to St Nicolas Church, Newbury. It was clearly first built in this spot during Norman times. Passepartout said it was built during the marriage of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. We joined some tourists who were admiring the clerestory. It functioned well as a vestry and contains the organ. I tripped over a peal of ten bells and a Holy Communion bell. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"John Winchcombe, commonly called Jack of Newberry." said Chris. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Chris and I walked to West Berkshire Museum. Chris told me it was built in 1626-1627 by Richard Emmes. It was clearly subsequently used as a workhouse. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a workhouse?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was used as a workhouse. At this point, Chris entered a nearby museum and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We parked near Thatcham railway station. To the best of my recollection, this was served before privatisation by Network SouthEast and from 1996 until 2004 by Thames Trains. Passepartout said it was opened on 21 December 1847 as part of the Berks and Hants Line to Hungerford. It seemed perfect for the delivery of equipment. It was within convenient distance of a small car park. Things changed after railway nationalisation in 1948. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Kennet School. If I remembered correctly, this was given Technology College status. I remembered it was built on the north of the site to replace dispersed classrooms. I admired the annual income of just over £8. Passepartout explained how it had been designed to coincide with the 2006 FIFA World Cup. We avoided changes in the way the points are calculated. <p class="new">Much later we arrived near Midgham railway station. Passepartout told me it was planned by the Berks and Hants Railway. If I remembered correctly, this was absorbed by the Great Western Railway (GWR). Passepartout remembered it becoming "Midgham Halt" but on 5 May 1969 it reverted to "Midgham". I admired the small shelter and a small car park. We took advantage of the only access between the platforms. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Aldermaston railway station. I could see that it was opened on 21 December 1847. Passepartout said it was built by the Berks and Hants Railway. We admired the flanking platform on each side of the double track line. It functioned well as a headshunt for access to a nearby freight facility. It was handy for a nearby freight facility. Things changed after the Privatisation of British Railways. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was running short, so we  retraced our steps to Theale railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Heart Berkshire. Unless I was mistaken, this was an Independent Local Radio station. My guidebook claimed it was part of The One Network group of stations owned and operated by Global Radio. <h2>Chapter 66</h2><p class="new">We walked to Wargrave railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Shiplake Lock. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was built by the Thames Navigation Commission in 1773! Passepartout said it was known as "Cotterell's". It seemed perfect for sleeping. At this point, John entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I hitched a lift to Shiplake College. I could see that it was founded in 1959 by Alexander and Eunice Everett. Passepartout asked me if it was bought by Robert Harrison in 1888 and the original buildings date from 1890, but I did not know. I admired the extensive learning development department to provide support to all students. The mood here changed after in 1943 the BBC Monitoring Service moved to Caversham and the house became a hostel for BBC staff. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  retraced our steps to Shiplake railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Marsh Lock. I remembered it was built by the Thames Navigation Commission in 1773. It looked as if it was the third downstream of the eight locks built after the navigation act of 1770. It was convenient for rejoin the path for the section between Lashbrook Ferry and Shiplake Lock. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was River and Rowing Museum. It was clearly also UK National Heritage Museum of the Year in 1999. My guidebook claimed it was officially opened in November 1998 by Queen Elizabeth II. Passepartout remembered it becoming world famous. We took advantage of a unique interpretation of the River Thames from source to sea. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Kenton Theatre. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was founded 7 November 1805 and is the fourth oldest working theatre in the United Kingdom. If I remembered correctly, this was rebuilt and painted by the nationally reputed 20th century local artist John Piper. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for a period." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Friar Park. Passepartout told me it was owned by Sir Frank Crisp from 1889 until his death in 1919. Imagine my surprise to learn it was then sold at an auction to Sir Percival David! Times certainly changed after the murder of John Lennon in December 1980. We were greeted by a fellow tourist, who introduced themselves as Henry. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a dream on a hill and it came, not by chance, to the right man at the right time." said Henry. <p class="new">Moving on, we arrived at Henley Town F.C.. Imagine my surprise to learn it was playing in the FA Cup and! Passepartout said it was a full member of the Football Association. Things were never the same after securing the use of the Mill Lane Sports Centre and the Triangle from the town council. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Fawley Court. Passepartout asked me if it was given by William I to his kinsman Walter Giffard, but I did not know. I could see that it was one of the leading compilers of the Domesday Book. We admired the private promenade covering approximately half of the course. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was a school?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naturally." I replied. Things were different after it passed through the marriage of the Sackville heiress Margery. We moved on, unsure what to make of a lack of students of Polish origin. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Hambleden Lock. It was clearly built by the Thames Navigation Commission in 1773. Passepartout asked me if it was also a weir here then, but I did not know. It seemed handy for the track leading to the lock is immediately to the west of the Flower Pot pub. We made full benefit of public open space on the Henley side of the river. Things were never the same after the middle of the nineteenth century. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Hambleden Mill. Passepartout asked me if it was Grade II listed in 1955, but I did not know. If I remembered correctly, this was mentioned in the Domesday Book when it had a rent of £1/year. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most beautiful place in the whole length of the long Thames valley." said Henry. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Greenlands. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was owned in the seventeenth century by the D'Oyley family. It was clearly owned by Thomas Darby-Coventry and a house called Greenland Lodge was built. Henry explained how it had been designed to provide management education to British men and women in all sectors of the economy and government. Things were different after immediately after the Second World War. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Bisham Abbey. It looked as if it was previously named Bisham Priory. Unless I was mistaken, this was the traditional resting place of many Earls of Salisbury. Passepartout observed that it wasn't to last though as it was finally dissolved on 19 June 1538. It was hard to believe it was ever a residential training camp base for athletes and teams and community groups alike. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Sir William Borlase's Grammar School. Unless I was mistaken, this was founded on its present site in 1624 by Sir William Borlase in memory of his son Henry Borlase. I remembered it was descended from Taillefer of Angoulême. We admired the collection of facilities of varying vintages. I spent a while perusing a theatre. Things changed after recently used to teach mathematics. We attended a mediocre production of 'Les Miserablés'. At this point, Henry noticed the time and said they had to leave, saying that they had business to attend to back at Friar Park. <p class="new">We hailed a cab to Marlow F.C.. Imagine my surprise to learn it was assisted by Marcus Richardson and is now assisted by Neville Roach! Passepartout said it was formed at a meeting at the Compleat Angler Hotel on 22 November 1870. Things were never the same after being relegated at the end of the 1994-95 season. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was running short, so we  walked to Cookham railway station and caught the next train, alighting near Cliveden. Imagine my surprise to learn it was the meeting place of the Cliveden set of the 1920s and 1930s -- a group of political intellectuals! As far as I knew, this was occupied by Stanford University. Passepartout remembered it becoming the setting for key events of the notorious Profumo Affair. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure this was the hotel's main dining room and also has river views?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. I found and admired a massed-planting effect of silver-evergreen Senecio "Sunshine" and Santolina. We took advantage of water for the house today. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was called the Profumo Affair which in turn led to the fall of the Macmillan government. We traversed the curved corridors. Things were different after the estate was purchased by George Hamilton. We met Henry, a college friend of mine who had heard about our journey. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The work accomplished by the brilliant plan of architect Charles Barry in 1851." said Henry. We noted the 1st Lord Astor. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Cookham Lock. Passepartout told us a long story about  further litigation from Lord Boston for loss of trade to the wharf he owned there. I remembered it was placed across the old navigation channel in 1837. It was clearly formerly down Hedsor Water and the only weir was associated with the mill. We visited the artist Stanley Spencer whose works include Swan Upping at Cookham. We moved on, avoiding the shallow waters. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hitched a lift to Stanley Spencer Gallery. If I recalled correctly, this was opened in 1962 and is located in the Thameside village of Cookham. Passepartout asked me if it was born and spent much of his life, but I did not know. We enjoyed during the Second World War when sent to Lithgows Shipyard. It seemed perfect for various activities. At this point, Henry entered a nearby museum and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder cracked in the distance as we approached Cookham Bridge. Passepartout told me it was first opened in 1840 in place of a ferry but the present structure dates from 1867. I recalled it was another 1&comma;400 years before a bridged crossing at Cookham was seriously in prospect again. Things were never the same after the construction of Maidenhead Bridge in 1280. <p class="new">We chartered a private plane which touched down not too far from Dorneywood. As far as I knew, this was occupied by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. Unless I was mistaken, this was forced to relinquish occupancy of Dorneywood. Passepartout was unimpressed by some decorations by Rex Whistler. Passepartout mourned it having been taken over by Alistair Darling. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Caldicott School. It looked as if it was master-in-charge of cricket. If I remembered correctly, this was completed to provide a theatre for drama and music and a venue for functions. Passepartout recounted how it had been prosecuted and found guilty of indecent assault and possessing indecent images of children in 2003. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We alighted from a bus near Burnham railway station. My guidebook claimed it was named Burnham Beeches. It was clearly closed as a First World War economy measure from 2 April 1917 to 3 March 1919. Passepartout and I admired the fully staffed ticketing office which is open 7 days a week. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was this really one of the main stops for passengers who commute to and from Slough Trading Estate?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of course." I said. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Taplow railway station. Passepartout talked about  permanent Saturday opening. Passepartout told me it was opened on 4 June 1838 as Maidenhead (referred to as Maidenhead Riverside in some publications). It looked as if it was renamed Maidenhead and Taplow in August 1854. Passepartout observed that it didn't lead to permanent Saturday opening. Passepartout said it was believed to have been designed by GWR architect J&period; E&period; Danks. The mood here changed after the opening of Maidenhead Railway Bridge and the line to on 1 July 1839. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We made our way to Maidenhead Bridge. Passepartout asked me if it was built of wood in 1280 in what was then the hamlet of South Ellington, but I did not know. It looked as if it was then the hamlet of South Ellington. We entered into conversation with a dishevelled character, who introduced themselves as John. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, John and I hitched a lift to Taplow Court. I recalled it was excavated in 1883 and a number of treasures were discovered. It was clearly owned by the monks at Merton Priory until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. We visited the Earl and Countess of Orkney who has also owned the adjacent Cliveden. I admired the slate roof. Things were never the same after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. <p class="new">Passing Maidenhead Railway Bridge, we approached Boulter's Lock. My guidebook told me it was first built here by the Thames Navigation Commission in 1772. Passepartout asked me if it was located in what is now the main weir, but I did not know. Passepartout commented that it didn't allow the Thames Navigation Commission to build locks below Maidenhead Bridge. It seemed a fine spot for the immediate surrounding area. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! The Cliveden Set and the Profumo Affair!" said Passepartout. At this point, John entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Old Field, Bray. Passepartout asked me if it was the home venue of Maidenhead Cricket Club when it was founded in the second half of the 18th century, but I did not know. He said it was founded in the second half of the 18th century. It seemed quite suitable for first-class matches by the Berkshire county team which was very strong at that time. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Maidenhead railway station. It looked as if it was the line's first terminus. It was clearly no station on the present site until 1871. We admired the overall roof. It functioned well as a walk through route. Passepartout looked up at the statue of Nicholas Winton, a British humanitarian who organized the rescue of 669 children. The sculptor had captured the place to stay and a warranty of £50 was deposited for their eventual return to their own country perfectly. We were impressed that somebody who was awarded the highest honour of the Czech Republic should have such a statue in Maidenhead railway station. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Claires Court School. Passepartout pointed out  separate single sex boys and girls sections providing education to 16+. Imagine my amazement to learn it was appointed as Master in charge of the Senior School! Unless I was mistaken, this was joined by Hugh as Bursar. I admired the successful athletics program. <h2>Chapter 67</h2><p class="new">Much later we arrived near Kedermister Library. Passepartout asked me if it was established to provide for the education of the rector of St&period; Mary's, but I did not know. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was formerly in the county of Buckinghamshire! We took advantage of insight into scholarship and book collecting in the 17th century. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to St Bernard's Catholic Grammar School. It was clearly previously designated as a Humanities College. Passepartout said it was built by and for Charles Aldin. Passepartout commented that she didn't approve of her marriage to the much younger William Lehman Ashmead Bartlett. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I imagine this is a place for a year by the Welsh Charity School of Ashford." said Passepartout. <div class="divider"><img src="http://kevan.org/images/divider.png" width=131 height=18 alt="---"></div><p class="new">Time was running short, so we  made our way to Iver railway station and caught a train, alighting near Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha. I could see that it was established in England by Sikhs who had emigrated in the 1950s and early 1960s. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was at Shepherd's Bush Gurdwara! Things were never the same after it moved to 11 Beaconsfield Road. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I walked to Southall railway station. Unless I was mistaken, this was charged with manslaughter. We visited the GWR Preservation Group. Passepartout and I admired the ticket office and a newsagent's shop. It was certainly handy for platforms 3 and 4. We ignored the large Punjabi community in the local area. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Southall Railway Centre. My guidebook told me it was rebuilt as a six-road shed in 1884. Passepartout said it was replaced by a more modern British Railways constructed steam shed (Code: 81C). It seemed perfect for DMU maintenance for ten years before final operational closure under British Railways. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Ealing Hospital. Passepartout asked me if it was once part of Hanwell Asylum, but I did not know. It looked as if it was built in the late 1970s and opened 5 November 1979. I admired the overall 2 star status. Passepartout disapproved of it being better to move the facilities at Perivale to a new maternity unit located on the same site as Ealing General. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Hanwell railway station. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was not ready until December of that year; it opened on 1 December. To the best of my knowledge, this was discontinued as uneconomic after 30 September 1885. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suppose it's alright for journeys originating or ending at Hanwell with the exception of journeys to Heathrow." said Passepartout. It was within convenient distance of the platforms. Things were different after December of that year; it opened on 1 December. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing a main road, we approached Drayton Manor High School. It was clearly granted academy status in August 2011. My guidebook claimed it was recognised as the Headteacher of the Year for London. Passepartout remembered it becoming a Leading Edge school in July 2003. Passepartout took several photographs of the good practice in education alongside David Cameron in the 2014 Parliamentary Review. Things were never the same after it became a Leading Edge school in July 2003. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to West Ealing railway station. It looked as if it was opened in 1871 as Castle Hill and Ealing Dene on the Great Western Railway. To the best of my knowledge, this was constructed from London Paddington through Ealing to Maidenhead in 1836-38. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for journeys originating or ending at West Ealing." said Passepartout. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Pitzhanger Manor. Passepartout asked me if it was owned from 1800 to 1810 by the architect John Soane, but I did not know. My guidebook said it was through this marriage that the house then passed to his only surviving son Thomas Gurnell. Passepartout observed that it didn't start until after the death of its last resident. Passepartout remembered it becoming home to the daughters of Britain's only assassinated Prime Minister. It seemed perfect for wedding ceremonies. We made full benefit of a rough indication of the (considerable) size of the property as it then was. We traversed the both the District line and the Central line of London Underground. Things changed after in 1843 it became home to the daughters of Britain's only assassinated Prime Minister. We were greeted by a local, who introduced themselves as George. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pitzhanger Manor." said George. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to spare, we ran to Ealing Studios. I remembered it was first occupied by Will Barker Studios from 1902. It looked as if it was acquired by theatre producer Basil Dean. We enjoyed in the post-WWII years. We admired the purposely built film school on the lot and use of the studios. <p class="new">With no time to lose, we ran to University of West London. I remembered it was formally adopted on Wednesday 6 April 2011. It was clearly founded at what is now University of West London's Ealing campus. We visited the tallest building to be completed using Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) in the UK. Passepartout remembered it becoming Thames Valley College of Higher Education and in 2011 it was closed down. We enjoyed many new wave acts in the 1970s and 1980s. We made full benefit of support to research activities and research degree courses. We noted the relocation of nursing students. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We hailed a cab to Golden Mile (Brentford). It looked as if it was designed by Assael Architecture. I could see that it was so called due to the concentration of industry along this short stretch of road. It seemed quite suitable for the UK headquarters of Samsung. I found and admired the headquarters building of GlaxoSmithKline. At this point, George hailed a cab, saying that they had business to attend to back at Pitzhanger Manor. We noted the concentration of industry along this short stretch of road. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout and I walked to Sky News. Passepartout observed that it didn't exceed actual costs of the channel. We enjoyed exclusively by women to mark International Women's Day. It seemed handy for Sky News at these times. We took advantage of non-stop rolling news on television. Times certainly changed after November 1997 when BBC News launched a new 24-hour channel. We ignored the public service remit of the BBC and that it did not exceed actual costs of the channel. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to spare, we walked to Brentford and Isleworth (UK Parliament constituency). My guidebook claimed it was narrowly gained by the Conservatives. Imagine my surprise to learn it was held by the Conservatives from 1974 to 1997! We admired the higher number of professionals and much expensive housing. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout told me about London Butterfly House. It looked as if it was a visitor attraction in Brentford. Passepartout said it was a proposal to build a replacement Butterfly House in Gunnersbury Park. We avoided the Duke of Northumberland's plans to build a hotel complex on the land. <p class="new">A few streets away was Syon Monastery. It looked as if it was named after the Biblical Holy "City of David which is Zion" (1 Kings 8:1). I remembered it was the wealthiest convent in England. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't until 9 days later on 3 March 1415 that the King's founding charter was signed at Westminster. Passepartout said it was rumoured to have been almost due west of Sheen Palace. The mood here changed after 9 days later on 3 March 1415 that the King's founding charter was signed at Westminster. We were greeted by a local resident, who introduced themselves as Protector. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"S(igillum) commune monasterii Sc'i (sancti) Salvatoris de Syon london' dioc'." said Protector. We avoided proximity to the river. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We still had a long way to go, so we  doubled back to Syon Lane railway station and caught a train, alighting near Richmond Park Academy. I could see that it was formed in 2010 when academy status was granted to the predecessor Shene School. It looked as if it was granted to the predecessor Shene School. Protector remembered it becoming the Richmond Adult College and in 1978 transferred to the Parkshot site. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was an A&period;R&period;P and ambulance depot?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certainly." I replied. The mood here changed after the school's amalgamation with East Sheen County School for Boys in 1939. We avoided increased school building in neighbouring boroughs and the effect of the Great Depression. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at International Tennis Federation. My guidebook told me it was no longer played on grass. Imagine my surprise to learn it was based at Wimbledon until 1987! Passepartout remembered it becoming the officially recognised organisation with authority to control lawn tennis throughout the world. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at National Tennis Centre (United Kingdom). It looked as if it was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 29 March 2007. As far as I knew, this was previously based at the Queen's Club in West Kensington. Passepartout remarked that it didn't come up through the LTA system. Passepartout examined the administration of the LTA. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was University of Roehampton. I remembered it was the first college of higher education in the UK to admit women. Passepartout said it was established to further the values of Friedrich Fröbel. We enjoyed a proportion of research judged to be world-leading in terms of its originality and significance. It seemed handy for excellent nearby facilities. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Queen Mary's Hospital. My guidebook claimed it was officially opened by His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester on 1 November 2006. Passepartout said it was rushed to Queen Mary's in 1973. We made full benefit of general community services in addition to the special services for which it is famous. <p class="new">Passing King's Head, Roehampton, we approached St Joseph Church, Roehampton. Passepartout told me it was founded by the Jesuits in 1869 and designed by Frederick Walters. It looked as if it was the first church he designed for the Jesuits and would go on to design more buildings for them. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coach pulled up at Craven Cottage. Passepartout told me it was originally a royal hunting lodge and has history dating back over 300 years. I could see that it was formerly the home ground for rugby league team Fulham RLFC. Passepartout remembered it becoming clear how expensive such a plan would be. We joined some tourists who were admiring the significant community of expatriate Australians. It seemed perfect for choir singing and marching bands along with other performances. Passepartout was unimpressed by the corporate hospitality seating alongside Fulham fans. Things were never the same after it was destroyed by fire in May 1888. We were approached by a local shopkeeper, who introduced themselves as Archibald. We noted the Great Depression. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout, Archibald and I walked to Vesta Rowing Club. I remembered it was a Junior Senior IV at Walton Regatta. It was clearly the club's first finals day appearance at that August regatta in a sweep-oared boat. Passepartout observed that it didn't come until 1888 and that was a Junior Senior IV at Walton Regatta. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by was Imperial College Boat Club. Passepartout told me it was housed from 1919 in Thames Rowing Club but has had its own boathouse since 1938. He asked me if it was head coach and director of rowing at Imperial College Boat Club, but I did not know. The mood here changed after leaving in April 2013 to become lead coach at Rowing Ireland. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We approached Thames Rowing Club. It was clearly constructed in 1879 with several later additions. I recalled it was founded under the name City of London Rowing Club and according to its first rules. We visited Britain's greatest ever single sculler. I admired the junior squad and additionally provides facilities to London Youth Rowing. We helped ourselves to facilities to London Youth Rowing. <p class="new">Moving on, we arrived at London Rowing Club. Passepartout asked me if it was founded in 1856 at the instigation of Herbert Playford, but I did not know. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was removed from those five clubs in September 2012! We admired the substantial boathouse (altered and extended in 2008) by Putney Bridge. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We ran to Curlew Rowing Club. I remembered it was founded in 1866 and has been in Greenwich without interruption for over 130 years. I could see that it was held at Greenwich in 1787. It seemed handy for a complete multi-laned buoyed 2 km racing lake. Things were never the same after some of its members transferred their activities to Putney. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Putney Bridge. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was slightly down river to the north! I remembered it was also known as Fulham Bridge. It seemed quite suitable for all boat races through Putney in olympic class rowing boats. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was replaced. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next stop was Chelsea & Fulham railway station. Passepartout asked me if it was a railway station in Walham Green in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, but I did not know. It looked as if it was situated between the King's Road and Fulham Road. Times certainly changed after its reopening as a passenger line under British Rail. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to spare, we walked to Stamford Bridge (stadium). Passepartout asked me if it was used by the London Athletic Club until 1905, but I did not know. To the best of my knowledge, this was renovated into a modern. Passepartout observed that it didn't buy the ground. It functioned well as a venue for England international matches. I could hardly hear Bishop over the sound of the supporters. Did it span the entire northern end? We thought not. I found and admired the centenary museum and a memorial wall. We helped ourselves to spectators with one of the best views of the pitch and it is the only section to have survived the extensive redevelopment of the 90s. Passepartout recounted how it had been sold to property developers Marler Estates. Things changed after the terrace was demolished in 1994. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not from the bottle." said Bishop. We moved on, unsure what to make of the financial situation in the mid 1970s the other stands weren't finished until the 1990s. <p class="new">We walked to Brompton Cemetery. As far as I knew, this was originally known as the West of London and Westminster Cemetery. It looked as if it was closed to burials between 1952 and 1996. Bishop and I admired the central "nave" which runs from Old Brompton Road towards the central colonnade and chapel. It was hard to believe it was ever a location by photographers such as Bruce Weber (see "The Chop Suey Club"). Bishop explained how it had been designed to give the feel of a large open air cathedral. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Ideal Home Show. Imagine my amazement to learn it was devised by the Daily Mail newspaper in 1908 and continued to be run by the Daily Mail up until 2009! My guidebook claimed it was then sold to events and publishing company Media 10. I spent some time perusing sardonic lyrics about an imaginary visit to the Ideal Home Show Exhibition. At this point, Bishop noticed the time and said they had to leave, saying that they had to return to St. Mary's Church, Putney. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With no time to lose, we walked to Earl's Court tube station. Passepartout told me it was a busy decade for the DR. Unless I was mistaken, this was on the east side of Earls Court Road rather than the west. Passepartout remarked that it wasn't a success and was ended on 30 September 1880. It seemed quite suitable for Earl's Court station but not for the nearby Barons Court. We made full benefit of a history of the area. Things changed after 31 January 1905 when the service was cut back again to terminate at Addison Road. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Earls Court Exhibition Centre. Passepartout asked me if it was rebuilt in 1937 in its most recent art deco style exterior, but I did not know. It looked as if it was the largest such venue within central London. Passepartout admitted that he didn't profit from his efforts. We visited the Royal Tournament. Passepartout and I swapped stories about some of these facts and that Queen Victoria was a frequent visitor to the shows. Passepartout remembered it becoming a mass network of rail on derelict grounds. It was hard to believe it was ever one of the venues for both the 1948 and 2012 Olympic Games. We took advantage of a shop window for UK industries and sustains thousands of long-term jobs in the local area. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was completed at a cost of £1. Things changed after their reunion at Live 8 in 2005. We moved on, avoiding the increase in the event's popularity. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We strolled a short distance to Empress State Building. Passepartout told me it was 100 m tall with 28 floors. He asked me if it was briefly the tallest commercial building in London until Millbank Tower was built in 1962, but I did not know. The mood here changed after Millbank Tower was built in 1962. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we pay a visit to Effie Bancroft. It looked as if it was an English actress and theatre manager. It was clearly that of Fleance in Macbeth (1846). Passepartout and I enjoyed at the Prince of Wales's Theatre were Tame Cats (1868). Things changed after her marriage in December 1867 to Squire Bancroft. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We caught a cab to Gloucester Road tube station. Passepartout asked me if it was provided with four platforms sheltered by an elliptical glazed iron roof, but I did not know. Passepartout remarked that it didn't open until 1871 &ndash; and the service operated as a shuttle between the two stations. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wonder if this is a place for Art on the Underground installations." said Passepartout. We entered into conversation with a local, who introduced themselves as Leslie. <p class="new">We passed the site of Victoria and Albert Museum. Leslie told us a long story about  a passage through the building. Imagine my surprise to learn it was installed as a focal point in the rotunda at the V&A's main entrance! I could see that it was founded in 1852 and named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Passepartout observed that it wasn't until 1857 that the museum moved to the present site. We enjoyed a design for the museum. We joined some tourists who were admiring the splendid lecture theatre although this is seldom open to the general public. It functioned well as a school for children evacuated from Gibraltar. Passepartout took a photograph of the Frank Lloyd Wright's work in the collection. Did it focus on fashion? We were not sure. Passepartout was unimpressed by the offices and board room etc. It seemed handy for objects that are not currently on display to the public and scholars. We took advantage of information for the casual visitor as well as for school groups. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was emulated by some other British museums. Leslie explained to us how it had been designed to the north west of the garden the five-storey School for Naval Architects (also known as the science schools). Passepartout disapproved of it being funded through and operated independently. Passepartout looked up at the statue of St John the Baptist, a Jewish itinerant preacherCross. Passepartout thought the statue should have been wearing a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. Who could forget that famous line, "And we -- what are we to do?". The sculptor had captured the daughter by the name of Salome perfectly. It seemed fitting somebody who was a 'righteous and holy man' should have such a statue in Victoria and Albert Museum. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I trust that it will remain for ages a Monument of discerning Liberality and a Source of Refinement and Progress." said Leslie. We moved on, disappointed by lack of funding. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather improved as we approached Brompton Road tube station. My guidebook claimed it was used as the command centre of the 26th (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade. Unless I was mistaken, this was opened on 15 December 1906 by the Great Northern. Passepartout observed that it didn't reopen until 4 October of that year with services initially only calling there on weekdays. It functioned well as the command centre of the 26th (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade. Passepartout mourned it having been used as the town headquarters (THQ) of the University of London Air Squadron. Things were never the same after 4 October of that year with services initially only calling there on weekdays. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A few streets away was Holy Trinity Brompton. I remembered it was first developed and is one of the most influential churches in the Church of England. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was a part of the large parish of Kensington which was served only by the nearby St Mary Abbots church! Passepartout remembered it becoming the main focus for HTB as it sought to support Alpha's spread and growth. We admired the transient population. Things changed after in the early 1990s the Alpha course started gaining worldwide attention. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Brompton Oratory. Unless I was mistaken, this was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1845. My guidebook said it was then launched in 1874 for funds to build a church. Passepartout observed that it wasn't proceeded with. It functioned well as a dead drop by Soviet spies in Britain. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Passepartout suggested that we visit Brompton Road. I recalled it was halfway between Knightsbridge tube station and South Kensington tube station on the Piccadilly line. Things were never the same after it reaches Egerton Gardens and the area to the east of South Kensington tube station. We avoided a lack of traffic. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Harrods. Passepartout asked me if it was located south of the River Thames in Southwark, but I did not know. It looked as if it was listed as 'Harrod and Wicking. Leslie and I admired the retail space of 650000 sqft. Passepartout recounted how it had been withdrawn and formal apologies were made. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"People approach us from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar." said Leslie. We encounted some problems with its similarity. <p class="new">Passepartout, Leslie and I walked to Knightsbridge tube station. It was clearly opened on 15 December 1906 by the Great Northern. I recalled it was located on Brompton Road a short distance west of its junction with Knightsbridge and Sloane Street. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was demolished. We avoided the presence locally of the Harrods and Harvey Nichols emporiums. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving through the crowds, we approached Spaghetti House siege. I remembered it was an early use of fibre optic technology as a live surveillance technique. My guidebook claimed it was selling information to the newspapers. Passepartout observed that it didn't go to plan. Passepartout and I enjoyed based on the siege. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subsequently, at the trial it was claimed that the BLA did not exist and the accused were simply criminals who wished to rob the restaurant for personal gain." said Leslie. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing a main road, we approached Royal Thames Yacht Club. Imagine my surprise to learn it was established in 1775 when Prince Henry! Unless I was thinking of something else, this was Commodore for 20 years and today the Club's Commodore is HRH Prince Andrew. It was within convenient distance of the South Coast easy. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We sprinted to Hyde Park Corner tube station. It was clearly opened by the Great Northern. As far as I knew, this was until June 2010 used as a pizza restaurant. It functioned well as a pizza restaurant. We helped ourselves to a connection to the platforms. Things changed after June 2010 used as a pizza restaurant. We noted the presence of a crossover tunnel to the east of the station. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Apsley House. I remembered it was originally built in red brick by Robert Adam between 1771 and 1778 for Lord Apsley. Imagine my surprise to learn it was given the popular nickname of Number One! Passepartout examined the 1st Duke's collection of paintings. <p class="new">Moving through the crowds, we approached Hyde Park Corner. Passepartout asked me if it was topped with an equestrian statue of the Duke (by Matthew Cotes Wyatt), but I did not know. He said it was moved south and realigned to the axis of Constitution Hill in 1883. It was hard to believe it was ever a codeword to announce to the government the death of King George VI in 1952. We made full benefit of a gate into Hyde Park. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was replaced with the current work. We noted the statue of Lord Byron, an English poet and a leading figure in the Romantic movement. Passepartout thought the statue should have been wearing specially-made shoes in an attempt to hide the deformed foot. The sculptor had captured the travelling companion in his friend John Cam Hobhouse perfectly. We were impressed that somebody who was occasionally styled "John Byron Gordon of Gight" should have such a statue in Hyde Park Corner. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A fog descended as we approached Waterloo Vase. Imagine my surprise to learn it was shown a single massive block of marble; he asked for it to be preserved! I remembered it was presented unfinished to the Prince Regent in 1815 by Ferdinand. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did you say this was a garden ornament in the garden of Buckingham Palace?" asked Passepartout. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I replied. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, we arrived at Constitution Hill, London. Imagine my astonishment to learn it was enhanced in connection with the development of Buckingham Palace in the 1820s! I could see that it was the scene of three assassination attempts against Queen Victoria--in 1840 (by Edward Oxford). <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a short walk to Spencer House, London. Passepartout told me it was commissioned by John. Unless I was very much mistaken, this was John Vardy who had studied under William Kent. Passepartout remembered it becoming one of the first examples in London of the neoclassical style. At this point, Leslie entered a nearby house and bade us farewell. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered a short distance to Royal Automobile Club. I could see that it was originally in a block of flats at 4 Whitehall Court. Passepartout observed that it didn't have a formal "onward to destination" service for members. I found and admired a bowling alley and a rifle range. Passepartout spoke of the time when it was established as a charity to research and promote issues of safety. Things were different after the early 1980s the roadside assistance service was limited to locations away from home. <p class="new">We strolled a short distance to Royal Society. Passepartout made a joke about  its appropriation by the Lord Mayor. My guidebook claimed it was granted a royal charter by King Charles II as "The Royal Society". I could see that it was run under a set of rules still retained by the Bodleian Library. Passepartout remarked that it didn't harm Gresham but did lead to its appropriation by the Lord Mayor. Passepartout remembered it becoming customary to appoint society fellows to serve on government committees where science was concerned. We enjoyed £600 a year for the society. We admired the esquire's helmet; it is thought that either the engraver was ignorant of this rule. It was hard to believe it was ever accommodation for the Assistant Secretary. I spent a few minutes studying extended obituaries of deceased Fellows. We helped ourselves to subsidised communications and media skills courses for research scientists. We moved on, disappointed by the influence of French scientists and the Montmor Academy in 1657. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our time was up, and our journey was at an end.</p>
